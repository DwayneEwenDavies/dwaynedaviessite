I think many people, including many in science, do not grasp the meaning of this concept. Even though it is an important concept in science and all other spheres of thought.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the definition of possible that I am using in this article:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p id=\"htoc-relating-to-a-claim-for-which-there-is-some-evidence-for-a-claim-is-possible-if-some-evidence-exists-to-support-it-being-true-and-there-is-none-that-proves-that-it-is-not-true\">Relating to a claim for which there is some evidence for. A claim is possible if some evidence exists to support it being true and there is none that proves that it is not true.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"htoc-a-claim-is-possible-if-you-can-find-some-evidence-to-support-it\">A claim is possible if you can find some evidence to support it. <\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The claim does not have to be proven true, there simply needs to be some evidence in favor of it. I consider a theory which is proven possible as it meets the above criteria. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to take any claim seriously, you should first establish that the claim is at least possible. There must be some amount of evidence that supports the claim. There must be a reason that the claim is potentially true. That the claim being made matches the fact of reality.  If you cannot do this, then your claim is arbitrary. There is no way to connect it back to reality of any kind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something is not \u201cpossible\u201d simply because one cannot think why it is not true. One has to have a reason we should consider it to be true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cX is possible\u201d means: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p id=\"htoc-that-according-to-the-context-of-my-knowledge-there-is-some-evidence-that-x-is-true-and-none-that-proves-that-it-is-not-true\">That according to the context of my knowledge, there is some evidence that X is true and none that proves that it is not true.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that there may not be very <em>much<\/em> evidence that supports X, but there must be at least some evidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evidence might not be very conclusive, and the truth of X may still need to be verified. Tt least I have established the <em>possibility<\/em> of the claim. At least I have established some reason to believe that the claim might be valid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take an example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder if humans might have evolved via a process of natural selection from some other species. I have not yet established that this is possible. It is just speculation. That I have guessed that this might be the case is not the same as establishing that it is possible. A guess in the absence of evidence does not establish that something is possible.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"416\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/chimpGuy.jpg\" alt=\"Chimpanzee.\" class=\"wp-image-26305\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/chimpGuy.jpg 416w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/chimpGuy-260x300.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Hey, seems plausible to me, this chimp looks like many people I know &#8230;<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So, I then try to find evidence that would suggest such a thing. What kind of evidence might show this? I could look for evidence that ancient apes had primitive versions of some features humans have and that over time, later species of apes developed versions of these features that are ever closer to the version of those features shared by humans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, I could look at the skull of some very ancient apes. I might notice that these skulls have brain cases larger than some of their earlier relatives. These brain cases are larger than some other human relatives. However, their brain cases are not as large as the brain cases possessed by human skulls. I may then notice that later species of apes have still larger brain cases. And later generations have still larger brain cases than that. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so on, so that the closer these species get to humans in time, the larger the brain cases possessed by these apes and the more human like their brain cases are. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would this show? It suggests that as time progresses, that the successive species of apes are becoming more and more like humans in terms of their brain cases. We can say the same about other skeletal structures and parts of their genome! We can show that over time, we see apes that are developing increasingly human-like pelvises, for instance.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/lucySkull.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"256\" height=\"258\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/lucySkull.jpg\" alt=\"Skull of an ancient pre-human ape.\" class=\"wp-image-26308\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/lucySkull.jpg 256w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/lucySkull-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/lucySkull-70x70.jpg 70w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">There is much evidence that man evolved from other apes. Evidence such as this Australopithecus skull.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it seems possible that man evolved from an ape! I have not simply asserted that it is so because I imagine it is so. I have concluded that it might be so, based on some evidence that seems to suggest this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Am I certain of this? No, I might not be. I might think that this is not very conclusive yet. However, I have some reason, based on evidence, to think that it might be true. I have a <em>basis<\/em> for my belief that man evolved from these earlier species of apes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, in the modern age, we have now proven beyond all rational doubt humans did indeed evolve from other apes and that humans are still apes! We have so much evidence for this that it would be perverse to suggest that we did not evolve from apes. Sadly, this does not stop millions of Creationists from asserting that we did not evolve from apes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, suppose that I simply declare that man evolved from apes. Suppose that I have no evidence of any kind to suggest that this is true. I just assert that it is so because I simply believe it to be so, based on faith.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is speculation. It is not the same as establishing that something is possible. You have no reason, no evidence, to believe it might be true. One cannot base an argument solely on speculation. Then you have simply asserted it on faith.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<p>Asserting that something is true in the absence of evidence is taking it on faith that it is true. That is what faith is, choosing to believe something for no reason. Asserting that evolution happens but having no evidence for it would be just as much an exercise in faith as asserting that God exists. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"htoc-the-fact-that-it-happens-to-be-true-does-not-mean-that-you-have-established-its-possibility\">That evolution is true does not mean that you have established the truth or that it is possible until you have evidence for it.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"htoc-just-because-a-claim-is-true-does-not-mean-it-is-possible-in-the-absence-of-evidence\">Just because a claim is true does not mean you have established that it is  true or possible in the absence of evidence.<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Here, you would have no reason to think it is true. The theory of evolution has always described reality, but until I discover evidence for it, nobody had any reason to consider it to be possibly true. <br><br>You have not established something as possible until you provide evidence that it is so. Even if your claim is true, until you do this, you have not established that it is possible and it is baseless speculation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, when Darwin presented his theory of evolution by natural selection in the <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/1228\/1228-h\/1228-h.htm\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/1228\/1228-h\/1228-h.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Origin of Species<\/a><\/em>, he presented a lot of evidence, thus establishing that his theory was not only possible, but by far the most likely explanation for the observed phenomena.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For something to be possible, you must have a reason, based on evidence, to think that it is so.&nbsp;It also has to not contradict known facts, as we shall see in a moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to this definition of \u201cpossible\u201d, it is not true that \u201canything is possible\u201d. Unless you can establish a reason to believe something is true, it is has not been established as possible. Nothing is possible until there is the slightest bit of evidence that shows that it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You cannot say that it is &#8220;possible&#8221; that you can walk to the Sun. There is no reason to think that this is possible. As we shall soon see, we have good reason to think that this is <em>impossible<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-counts-as-evidence\">What Counts as Evidence?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>What would qualify as evidence? Either some perceptual fact or conceptual argument would qualify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A perceptual fact would be some directly observable fact, something you can observe directly via sight or one of the other senses. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose that you want evidence that there is such a thing as an emu. Going out and seeing an emu would be pretty good perceptual evidence that emus are real! Or suppose that you want evidence that Jupiter has more than one moon. Well, you can observe that yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conceptual evidence are facts that support a claim which are not directly observable by the senses. <br><br>Suppose that I was to say that Musk cannot fit his full crew of 100 onto the Starship. What evidence could I provide for this?<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"338\" height=\"450\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/MuskPublicDomainSmaller.jpg\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" class=\"wp-image-26318\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/MuskPublicDomainSmaller.jpg 338w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/MuskPublicDomainSmaller-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photos of the Post Launch Press Conference after a successful launch of SpaceX CRS-8 and successful landing of the Falcon 9 rocket on the barge.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I could wait to see if he builds it and then wait to see if he tries to put a crew of 100 on it and watch this fail. We can directly observe this, and this might be another example of perceptual evidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do not have to wait for Musk to fail to get a crew of 100 onto his Starship. Instead, we can provide conceptual evidence that this is not workable. How can we do this? Let me show how this might be done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Starship has a payload capacity of 220,000 pounds. However, we can show that the amount of food and water required for a crew of 100 would be roughly 260,000 pounds. <br><br>Therefore, the weight of food and water for a crew of 100 would exceed the payload capacity of Starship. This is interesting conceptual evidence that the Starship cannot feasibly support a crew of 100 as proposed at the time of writing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take essentially any mathematical theorem. Let us take a simple one, like the Pythagoras Theorem. Here is the equation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>c<sup>2<\/sup> = a<sup>2<\/sup> + b<sup>2<\/sup><\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This theorem relates all three sides of a right-angled triangle. It says that the sums of the squares of the two shorter sides equal the square of the third, longest side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you provide perceptual evidence for this? You could observe a lot of right-angled triangles and you should find that this holds. How would you know that this holds for all right-angled triangles?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You would use mathematical facts that we know to be true and use those facts to prove that the Pythagoras Theorem applies to all triangles and not just the ones we have measured. We can show this conceptually, using mathematical concepts.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"278\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pythagoras-1.jpg\" alt=\"Pythagoras of Samos\" class=\"wp-image-26316\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pythagoras-1.jpg 278w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Pythagoras-1-209x300.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Pythagoras was a great mathematician, but a terrible philosopher, as we shall eventually see.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-impossible\">The Impossible<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Lots of things are not established as possible and cannot be so.&nbsp;No evidence has ever been given to support the truth of such claims.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that all gods fall into this category. Noone has ever provided valid evidence for any god. Since supernatural entities allegedly supersede nature, they will never provide such evidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We shall also see that not only has the possibility of any god not been established, their impossibility can be definitively proven.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"htoc-if-you-can-establish-if-x-was-true-it-would-contradict-a-known-fact-then-x-cannot-be-possible\">If you can establish that if X was true, it would contradict a known fact, then X cannot be possible.<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>There cannot be any contradictions in reality. Nothing that is true contradicts something else that is true. If you know Y is true, but X contradicts Y, then X is impossible. Thus, its possibility obviously cannot be established.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say that I wish to establish that man is a dinosaur. As you know, dinosaurs lay eggs and do not bear live young. They also do not feed their young milk using mammary glands. However, humans bear live young and feed their young using mammary glands, just like other mammals!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humans also have hair, and no dinosaur has hair! In addition, humans also replace their teeth only one time while dinosaurs have no such limitation. Humans also have diaphragms, something only mammals possess and certainly not dinosaurs. Humans have three bones in the middle ear, which is a diagnostic feature of a mammal and a feature no dinosaur could possess. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<p>And it goes on like this. We can identify several features of humans that no dinosaur could share. These facts show that man is a mammal and, therefore, cannot be a dinosaur.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if a man was a dinosaur, this would contradict the known fact that man is mammal. Not only is there no evidence that man is a dinosaur, no such evidence could exist. The possibility of man being a dinosaur has therefore not been established.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can go beyond saying that it has not been established as possible for man to be a dinosaur, we can say that it is impossible for man to be a dinosaur!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A claim is impossible when:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p id=\"htoc-a-claim-has-not-been-established-as-possible-and-the-evidence-contradicts-it\">A claim has not been established as possible, and the evidence contradicts it.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"htoc-that-which-contradicts-with-any-known-fact-of-reality-is-impossible\">That which contradicts any known fact of reality is impossible. <\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you make a claim that would require something to contradict its nature or which otherwise contradicts known facts of reality, then you are making an absurd claim of impossibility. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gods always seem to be defined as immortal entities with supernatural and magical abilities. As supernatural abilities are a synonym for magic, a being with magical abilities. It is easy to see that no being could be immortal or possess such reality-defying abilities. Therefore, any god qua magical being is by its supposed nature, is impossible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can thus say it is impossible for any such Creator God to exist. Therefore, it is impossible for him to have created the universe. <\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"350\" height=\"272\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/CreatorGod-1.jpg\" alt=\"God in the clouds.\" class=\"wp-image-26317\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/CreatorGod-1.jpg 350w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/CreatorGod-1-300x233.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Hey God, go away, nobody asked you!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Is there a difference between &#8220;not established as possible&#8221; and &#8220;impossible&#8221;? Yes, there is, and it is an important distinction. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you say, &#8220;not established as possible&#8221;, you are pointing out that no possibility has been established. You are saying that nobody has given you a reason to take that claim seriously. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when you say that something is impossible, this is not the same thing. You are not saying that the claim lacks any evidence, and that there is no reason to take it seriously. You are saying that the impossible claim is definitively false because of its clash with some aspect of reality. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose that I say that &#8220;evolution happens&#8221; but I have no evidence for it. That means that evolution has not been established as possible. Since I have not shown that it is possible. However, that does not mean that it is impossible and cannot happen. Only that I have not established the possibility that it happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is any of this important? Why can&#8217;t we just say that the possible are those things that occur to us and are possible if we have not shown that they are impossible?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there is no cognitive value in entertaining ideas which have no provable connection to the facts of reality. Such a thought or statement might as well not be said, as it has no cognitive value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The arbitrary is worse than the false. If you make a false statement such as &#8220;I am a pink unicorn&#8221;, then it can be shown that you are not a pink unicorn. You are not a horse and you certainly do not have a magical horn. So, it is clearly impossible for you to be a pink unicorn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose that you assert that the first house on some random street in Sri Lanka has a psychedelic rainbow android. Assume that we have no way to verify this information. This is a completely arbitrary statement with no demonstrable connection to reality. In the absence of any evidence, there is no way to know whether this is possible or impossible or true or false. It might be true. Who knows? If we cannot check the house or otherwise find out if it has a psychedelic rainbow android. in it, we have no way to know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we conclude anything about this claim? We can&#8217;t prove it true or false until we go there or communicate with this household, so until then there is no point thinking about it at all. At least if we knew it was false, we might do something with that fact. Sometimes knowing something is false is useful because at least you can rule one thing out. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one reason we should distinguish claims which have not shown to be possible from those shown to be impossible. The arbitrary is neither possible or impossible. We should distinguish arbitrary claims from impossible claims. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because the possibility of a claim has not been established, that does not make the claim impossible. Suppose that Charles Darwin had just asserted evolution happens. However, suppose that he presented no evidence. That does not mean evolution does not or cannot happen. It would just mean that we would have no reason to take Darwin&#8217;s claim seriously. A lack of evidence that something is true is not evidence that it is false.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Charles_Darwin_01.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Darwin\" class=\"wp-image-26313\" width=\"350\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Charles_Darwin_01.jpg 467w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Charles_Darwin_01-234x300.jpg 234w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">That is OK Darwin, we actually have lots of evidence for your theories&#8230;<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-does-this-matter\">Why Does this Matter?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p id=\"17ba\">The only claims of any merit are those that help us achieve some value in the world.
