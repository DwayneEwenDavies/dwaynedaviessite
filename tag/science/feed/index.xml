										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is an interview with the Objectivist computer scientist Martin Johansen.  We discussed his lecture &#8220;Charles Babbage: Induction in Computer Science&#8221;. You can and should purchase a copy of <a href="https://estore.aynrand.org/products/charles-babbage-induction-in-computer-science-mp3-download?_pos=1&amp;_sid=74692a7ab&amp;_ss=r" data-type="URL" data-id="https://estore.aynrand.org/products/charles-babbage-induction-in-computer-science-mp3-download?_pos=1&amp;_sid=74692a7ab&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this lecture here</a>.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-introduction">Introduction </h2>


<p>This is a great introduction to the role of induction in science in general, not just computer science. Although, of course, we covered a lot of computer science topics as well. </p>



<p>You should find this instructive and interesting even if you are not an expert on computer science or philosophy. Martin explains very clearly what induction is, why it is important and how it can be used in computer science and other fields. </p>



<p>We also discussed some of why it is dismissed today. As well as the irrational way modern academics such as Turing approach the field of computer science.<br><br>Here is the list of questions I prepared when asking him. I did not go very far off script. It gives you a pretty good idea of what we discussed. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="questions-on-computer-science">Questions on Computer Science</h2>


<p>What is your background in computer science and philosophy?</p>



<p>What is a computer and what is the origin of this this term?</p>



<p>Why did you choose to get into computer science?</p>



<p>You may have noticed that many Objectivists are into programming, why do you think that is?</p>



<p>What is induction?</p>



<p>Why is induction important? Also, why do you think so many people either don’t think about it or think that it is as impotent as they do?</p>



<p>Why do you think induction is so dismissed today?</p>



<p>How is a computer so useful in showing the immense power of induction?</p>



<p>Who was Charles Babbage?</p>



<p>What were some of his more interesting ideas?</p>



<p>What were the Difference and Analytical Engines? Do any of these machines qualify as a computer?</p>



<p>Why did he consider such machines so important in his time?</p>



<p>Why  were his machines not more widely employed in his time?</p>



<p>Who was Ada Lovelace and why do you suppose so few people know that name?</p>



<p>We might talk about this another time, but in the lecture you talk about the work of Francis Bacon. Do you think his work is relevant today?</p>



<p>Briefly, how might you use induction to invent something new, such as a computer?</p>



<p>Tell me about some of the philosophical ideas that are implicitly or explicitly held by many in this field today. In particular, talk about the influence of Bertrand Russell and his, let&#8217;s say, disciple, Alan Turning.</p>



<p>How does the philosophical ideas of Turing compare to Babbage?</p>



<p>What about their ideas on computers? How do they differ?</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on the Turing Test. Does it really have any useful implications when it comes to AI?</p>



<p>What are the fundamental philosophical errors committed by the concept of the Turing Machine? Is the Turing Machine of any practical purpose or any other valid purpose?</p>



<p>Tell us about what you call the “Disproof by arbitrary counterexamples” thing you mention in the lecture and the consequences of this?</p>



<p>Tell us about the difference between the views of Babbage and Turing when it comes to man’s mind.</p>



<p>What is the problem with mechanical materialism and does this have any implications to AI?</p>



<p>What about the Halting problem? Even when I studied this in college, before learning about Objectivism, I could not understand how this was valid. It clearly does not apply to real computers, only to Turing’s arbitrary theoretical computer. Right?</p>



<p>What is the analytic/synthetic dichotomy and how does it apply here?</p>



<p>What are some of the consequences of Turing’s ideas and its influence on computer science?</p>



<p>You have a good list of sources on your personal website. I will include a link to it in the description of this video. But are there any books or sources that you would like to to mention right now?</p>



<p>Ok, so are there any other comments you would like? Would you like to present a quick summary?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, we are exploring the concepts of the &#8220;possible&#8221; and &#8220;impossible&#8221; and their important role in cognition, particularly in the sciences.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-possible">The Possible</h2>


<p>We must first establish the proper meaning of “possible”. I think many people, including many in science, do not grasp the meaning of this concept. Even though it is an important concept in science and all other spheres of thought.</p>



<p>Here is the definition of possible that I am using in this article:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p id="htoc-relating-to-a-claim-for-which-there-is-some-evidence-for-a-claim-is-possible-if-some-evidence-exists-to-support-it-being-true-and-there-is-none-that-proves-that-it-is-not-true">Relating to a claim for which there is some evidence for. A claim is possible if some evidence exists to support it being true and there is none that proves that it is not true.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-a-claim-is-possible-if-you-can-find-some-evidence-to-support-it">A claim is possible if you can find some evidence to support it. </h3>


<p>The claim does not have to be proven true, there simply needs to be some evidence in favor of it. I consider a theory which is proven possible as it meets the above criteria. </p>



<p>In order to take any claim seriously, you should first establish that the claim is at least possible. There must be some amount of evidence that supports the claim. There must be a reason that the claim is potentially true. That the claim being made matches the fact of reality.  If you cannot do this, then your claim is arbitrary. There is no way to connect it back to reality of any kind.</p>



<p>Something is not “possible” simply because one cannot think why it is not true. One has to have a reason we should consider it to be true.</p>



<p>“X is possible” means: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p id="htoc-that-according-to-the-context-of-my-knowledge-there-is-some-evidence-that-x-is-true-and-none-that-proves-that-it-is-not-true">That according to the context of my knowledge, there is some evidence that X is true and none that proves that it is not true.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Note that there may not be very <em>much</em> evidence that supports X, but there must be at least some evidence.</p>



<p>The evidence might not be very conclusive, and the truth of X may still need to be verified. Tt least I have established the <em>possibility</em> of the claim. At least I have established some reason to believe that the claim might be valid.</p>



<p>Let’s take an example.</p>



<p>I wonder if humans might have evolved via a process of natural selection from some other species. I have not yet established that this is possible. It is just speculation. That I have guessed that this might be the case is not the same as establishing that it is possible. A guess in the absence of evidence does not establish that something is possible.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="416" height="480" src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chimpGuy.jpg" alt="Chimpanzee." class="wp-image-26305" srcset="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chimpGuy.jpg 416w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chimpGuy-260x300.jpg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hey, seems plausible to me, this chimp looks like many people I know &#8230;</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>So, I then try to find evidence that would suggest such a thing. What kind of evidence might show this? I could look for evidence that ancient apes had primitive versions of some features humans have and that over time, later species of apes developed versions of these features that are ever closer to the version of those features shared by humans.</p>



<p>For instance, I could look at the skull of some very ancient apes. I might notice that these skulls have brain cases larger than some of their earlier relatives. These brain cases are larger than some other human relatives. However, their brain cases are not as large as the brain cases possessed by human skulls. I may then notice that later species of apes have still larger brain cases. And later generations have still larger brain cases than that. </p>



<p>And so on, so that the closer these species get to humans in time, the larger the brain cases possessed by these apes and the more human like their brain cases are. </p>



<p>What would this show? It suggests that as time progresses, that the successive species of apes are becoming more and more like humans in terms of their brain cases. We can say the same about other skeletal structures and parts of their genome! We can show that over time, we see apes that are developing increasingly human-like pelvises, for instance.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucySkull.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="256" height="258" src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucySkull.jpg" alt="Skull of an ancient pre-human ape." class="wp-image-26308" srcset="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucySkull.jpg 256w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucySkull-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucySkull-70x70.jpg 70w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">There is much evidence that man evolved from other apes. Evidence such as this Australopithecus skull.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Therefore, it seems possible that man evolved from an ape! I have not simply asserted that it is so because I imagine it is so. I have concluded that it might be so, based on some evidence that seems to suggest this.</p>



<p>Am I certain of this? No, I might not be. I might think that this is not very conclusive yet. However, I have some reason, based on evidence, to think that it might be true. I have a <em>basis</em> for my belief that man evolved from these earlier species of apes.</p>



<p>Of course, in the modern age, we have now proven beyond all rational doubt humans did indeed evolve from other apes and that humans are still apes! We have so much evidence for this that it would be perverse to suggest that we did not evolve from apes. Sadly, this does not stop millions of Creationists from asserting that we did not evolve from apes. </p>



<p>However, suppose that I simply declare that man evolved from apes. Suppose that I have no evidence of any kind to suggest that this is true. I just assert that it is so because I simply believe it to be so, based on faith.</p>



<p>This is speculation. It is not the same as establishing that something is possible. You have no reason, no evidence, to believe it might be true. One cannot base an argument solely on speculation. Then you have simply asserted it on faith.</p>

<p>This is the transcript of an interview with my friend Narendra Kumar on the issue of science education. We discussed many things, including the difficulties of learning physics, problems with concretization, the role of mathematics and its relationship with science, the beauty of the science and more.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>I answered some of the questions he prepared in advance and he offered several insightful clarifying questions and commentary. It was a very good interview and we covered a lot of ground in about seventy minute.</p>



<p>This was supposed to be a livestream available on YouTube. However there were severe audio issues and much of the audio is unusable. However, I have created this transcript without losing anything significant from the original discussion.</p>



<p>At a later date I will present an audio reading of this interview which is mostly my answers but with several of Narendra&#8217;s insightful comments. For now, you have this transcript.</p>



<p>I trust that you will find this interesting and informative. The transcript is available below as a PDF, please <a href="http://localhost/rational/transcripts/MetaphysicsOfPhysicsInterviewWithNarendra.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="http://localhost/rational/transcripts/MetaphysicsOfPhysicsInterviewWithNarendra.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here download it</a>.</p>



<p>Please note that some of our interviews reference &#8220;Metaphysics of Physics&#8221;. This was the previous incarnation of the Rational Metaphysician.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="excerpt-of-the-interview-on-science-education">Excerpt of the Interview on Science Education</h2>


<p><strong>Dwayne</strong>: Okay. Hi everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Metaphysics of Physics.<br><strong><br>Narendra:</strong> Hi.<br><br>Today I have my friend Narendra with us from India, via the magic of the internet. Say hi to our audience.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Hello everybody!<br><strong><br>Dwayne:</strong> He teaches English studies. And he likes to use holistic education methods. And he has a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering and an MSc in Economics.<br><br>We are going to learn about some issues in science and science education. We&#8217;ll be focusing on physics, but a lot of other branches of science, particularly mathematics, will come up as well. Narendra has given me lots of good questions beforehand.<br><strong><br>Narendra:</strong> Yeah, they&#8217;ve already given. And so, thank you, Dwayne, I would like to say something.<br><br>I am happy that I&#8217;ve come on live with you. I&#8217;ve been watching your posts and the way you over-explain. I really love that. So, I thought we&#8217;ll connect, and thanks for agreeing to that.<br><br>And thanks also for the fantastic preparation you have done. Because I gave these questions much earlier, almost, I think two weeks back. And he wrote the answers down. So that&#8217;s very unique. People don&#8217;t do that.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>Well, I like to be prepared.<br><br><strong>Narendra: </strong>Yeah, I know, I know. I&#8217;d like to tell the audience that these questions have already been given. So, there&#8217;s no need for me to ask them. He will be telling the question.<br><br>And I will be adding things. If I think that there is anything if I feel a general audience needs it. If they need some clarification or if I need some clarification, I&#8217;ll butt in. But I would like Dwayne to talk.Dwayne: Yes.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Okay, then we go ahead.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>Okay, let&#8217;s get started with the first question. And this question is whether it is difficult to learn physics. And here&#8217;s what I have to say on that.<br><br>Now, of course, physics is a very fundamental subject. Some people might have the idea that this should make it easy, but I do not think that should be the case. Fundamental is not the same as easy.<br><br>The subject matter of physics is essentially all of physical reality. You can take the view that that is looking out at all of physical reality and seeing how all of this works. Basically, everything that is physical is something to do with physics.<br><br>But in practice, this is not actually easy. Once you start doing physics, you will very quickly find that you need math, lots of math, to do much of anything.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="450" height="338" src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hard-math.jpg" alt="Complicated math." class="wp-image-26413" srcset="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hard-math.jpg 450w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hard-math-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is not where physics stops. It where it should really get going &#8230;</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Narendra:</strong> Yes.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> You need to be able to quantify the things like velocity, and acceleration and forces and how forces lead to motion and stuff. You need mathematics to identify, quantify, understand all these relationships. We will go into the role of math in a later question, and so we won&#8217;t go into that too<br>much now.<br><br><strong>Narendra: </strong>Yeah.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> But the math can get really complicated, really fast. And not everyone is good at math. Certainly not in my experience. It is a very abstract subject, and it&#8217;s very difficult for some, even if it is taught properly. And in my experience, it seldom is.<br><br>Add to that the fact that you&#8217;re dealing with some very abstract things like energy. We don&#8217;t know what energy is really and Feynman himself said we don&#8217;t know. And he was one of the greatest physicists of his time.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> He did not know; you can imagine it was undefined.</p>



<p><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Yeah, that was a perfectly valid point. So, in other words, energy is not easy to intuitively grasp. And then there&#8217;s light. We don&#8217;t know what light really is. They say it&#8217;s a particle and a wave. But, well, no.<br><br>Even trying to visualize an atom can be hard. Remember the show the Big Bang Theory? You have that picture of the electrons orbiting the nucleus like little moons.<br><br>This is an okay way of visualizing an atom. It is good enough for high school physics, maybe first-year college physics. But according to quantum physics, this is wrong. But how do we visualize it?<br><strong><br>Narendra:</strong> Exactly.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>We don&#8217;t know, quantum physics has not given us an answer. It doesn&#8217;t give us any answers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Some people, including alleged champions of reason and science think that there is no such thing as settled science. Let's bust that unscientific nonsense.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Is there any such thing as settled science? I am going to argue that there is.</p>



<p>What do I mean by &#8220;settled&#8221; science? A scientific claim that any rational person would accept as true and established beyond any reasonable doubt. We do not expect such theories to be replaced by an alternate theory.</p>



<p>You might object that this is not very scientific! We must always keep in mind that we might be wrong. We need to be ready to adjust what we know to accommodate new information that might cast what we know today into doubt. Keep in mind that we are fallible and that we might come to invalid conclusions.</p>



<p>All knowledge, including science, is contextual. We study reality and, based on what we observe, we form logical conclusions. But we can only account for that we know about.</p>



<p>For instance, take Newtonian gravity. In the context of not knowing what happens near the speed of light, it was entirely reasonable to accept Newton&#8217;s laws of gravity as settled science. We did not know what happened at extremely high velocities, so we had no reason to doubt Newtonian gravity. Newtonian gravity is valid, within the context of things not moving close to the speed of light. </p>



<p>We then expanded our context to account for things near light speed. We realized that in that context, Einstein’s relativity provides better mathematics for what happens with gravity at near light speed. Does that mean that we had no reason to be certain about Newtonian gravity? </p>



<p>No, it does not. We knew it was an accurate description of gravity at speeds much lower than the speed of light.</p>



<p>That is why NASA uses Newtonian gravity for most purposes, even though relativistic equations would be more accurate. Newtonian gravity is easier to deal with and is extremely accurate at the speeds NASA works with.</p>

So, Newton&#8217;s gravity equations will work just fine thanks.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Certainty is contextual. Suppose, in the context of our knowledge, the available evidence supports a theory. We should be certain about that theory. But what we are wrong? After all, we used to believe some strange things.</p>



<p>We used to think things burned because of phlogiston. Phlogiston was a mysterious substance that was thought to exist in all combustible bodies.</p>



<p>We used to think that dinosaurs were all sluggish, scaly critters that probably lived in swamps to support their massive weight.</p>



<p>Yes, sometimes we are wrong. Sometimes the facts do not support our theories. There are some theories that we have no business accepting as anything more than a plausible hypothesis.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="these-are-the-theories-that-do-not-make-up-the-body-of-settled-science-these-are-the-theories-we-should-not-consider-settled">These are the theories that do not make up the body of settled science. These are the theories we should not consider settled. </h3>


<p>It would be dishonest to consider a theory settled in the absence of evidence. It would also be dishonest to consider a theory settled if we did not understand it well enough to be sure it was consistent with all the available evidence.</p>



<p>Some theories are entirely reasonable within the context of the available evidence. Sometimes all the known evidence points to these theories being true. </p>



<p>Sometimes we understand the theory well enough to conclude it is entirely consistent with the facts. If the facts are consistent with that theory and only that theory, then we can be certain that the theory in question is true.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-should-not-entertain-serious-doubts-about-theories-that-have-substantial-evidence-behind-them">We should not entertain serious doubts about theories that have substantial evidence behind them. </h3>


<p>We can always <em>imagine</em> that we might disprove some theories. However, we should be certain about a theory if all the available evidence points to it being true.</p>



<p>Certainty does not require us to account for, by magic, for the possibility of a context of knowledge we do not currently possess. We can be certain that something is true even if there is something we do not know about now that may later show that it is not true.</p>



<p>Certainty is contextual, it is valid to be certain based on the context of available evidence. Provided that we are willing to address any evidence that arises, should the context of our knowledge change. We can be certain something is true. And yet adjust our theories when the context of our knowledge expands.</p>



<p>However, there are theories that we can consider completely and forever settled. These are theories we know with certainty and can prove with no shadow of a doubt to be true.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-know-these-facts-are-true-and-that-we-cannot-show-them-to-be-false">We know these facts are true and that we cannot show them to be false.</h3>


<p>It would contradict known facts of reality if they were not true. Things would have to not be what we know they are.</p>



<p>Examples of these would be that atoms exist. We know atoms exist; we have seen them. If they did not exist, almost everything we know about chemistry and atomic physics would not be true.</p>



<p>We know evolution happens. We might not know everything about how it happens, but we know it does. If I wanted disprove evolution, we would have to invalidate almost everything we know about biology and the known facts of biology would have to be other than what they are.</p>



<p>We know the Earth is round and that it orbits the Sun. To invalidate this, the direct evidence of our senses would have to be wrong! That we can see that the Earth is round would have to be fake. And how would we explain the observed behavior of Earth if it does not orbit the Sun? </p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="450" height="450" src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-26164" srcset="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller.jpg 450w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller-70x70.jpg 70w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It is much more scientific to think this might be real, right?</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We can say without a shadow of a doubt that theories like this are absolutely and forever settled and that we will never find anything that contradicts them. No such evidence is even <a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/the-possible-and-the-impossible/" data-type="post" data-id="35">possible</a>. </p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-completely-settled-such-science-it-would-be-nonsensical-to-pretend-otherwise">We completely settled such science. It would be nonsensical to pretend otherwise!</h3>


<p>So yes, there is such a thing as settled science. It is foolish to pretend otherwise. And it would be intellectually dishonest and non-scientific to pretend that we have not settled this!</p>



<p>It is unscientific to question that the Earth might not be round. Or that evolution does not happen. Or that atoms do not exist. Why? Because we have seen that the Earth is round! Are we to question the evidence of our senses so that we can become a Flattard?</p>



<p>It would contradict the obvious implications of the evidence of our senses to believe atoms do not exist. Additionally, we have seen atoms! It would go against observable facts and their logical implications to question that evolution happens.</p>



<p>It would be unscientific to question that light behaves like a wave. This would go against the evidence of our senses and the logical implications of that evidence.</p>



<p>To question theories we can show are irrefutable facts based on the evidence of our senses and the logical implications of such, is unscientific.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="your-belief-that-the-irrefutable-facts-of-reality-might-be-wrong-is-completely-nonsensical-and-unscientific">Your belief that the irrefutable facts of reality might be wrong is completely nonsensical and unscientific. </h3>


<p>The ability to entertain alternatives to the way reality works is not indicative of science. It is closer to the mindset of the religious person that must evade reality to maintain the possibility of his delusions. The questioning of everything, even things we can prove beyond any reasonable doubt, is little better than those that deny science outright. </p>



<p>To deny the absolute certainty of that which we can show beyond any reasonable doubt, is to either partially deny the veracity of the evidence or fail to understand that science is about the study of an objective reality, not blind guesswork.</p>
