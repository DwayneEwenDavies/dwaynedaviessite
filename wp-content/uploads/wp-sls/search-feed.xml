		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, we are exploring the concepts of the "possible" and "impossible" and their important role in cognition, particularly in the sciences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:simpletoc/toc {"use_ol":true,"remove_indent":true,"updated":1668983300249} /-->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="the-possible">The Possible</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We must first establish the proper meaning of “possible”. I think many people, including many in science, do not grasp the meaning of this concept. Even though it is an important concept in science and all other spheres of thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is the definition of possible that I am using in this article:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="htoc-relating-to-a-claim-for-which-there-is-some-evidence-for-a-claim-is-possible-if-some-evidence-exists-to-support-it-being-true-and-there-is-none-that-proves-that-it-is-not-true">Relating to a claim for which there is some evidence for. A claim is possible if some evidence exists to support it being true and there is none that proves that it is not true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="htoc-a-claim-is-possible-if-you-can-find-some-evidence-to-support-it">A claim is possible if you can find some evidence to support it. </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The claim does not have to be proven true, there simply needs to be some evidence in favor of it. I consider a theory which is proven possible as it meets the above criteria. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to take any claim seriously, you should first establish that the claim is at least possible. There must be some amount of evidence that supports the claim. There must be a reason that the claim is potentially true. That the claim being made matches the fact of reality.  If you cannot do this, then your claim is arbitrary. There is no way to connect it back to reality of any kind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Something is not “possible” simply because one cannot think why it is not true. One has to have a reason we should consider it to be true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“X is possible” means: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="htoc-that-according-to-the-context-of-my-knowledge-there-is-some-evidence-that-x-is-true-and-none-that-proves-that-it-is-not-true">That according to the context of my knowledge, there is some evidence that X is true and none that proves that it is not true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Note that there may not be very <em>much</em> evidence that supports X, but there must be at least some evidence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The evidence might not be very conclusive, and the truth of X may still need to be verified. Tt least I have established the <em>possibility</em> of the claim. At least I have established some reason to believe that the claim might be valid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s take an example.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wonder if humans might have evolved via a process of natural selection from some other species. I have not yet established that this is possible. It is just speculation. That I have guessed that this might be the case is not the same as establishing that it is possible. A guess in the absence of evidence does not establish that something is possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26305,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"is-style-default"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chimpGuy.jpg" alt="Chimpanzee." class="wp-image-26305"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hey, seems plausible to me, this chimp looks like many people I know ...</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I then try to find evidence that would suggest such a thing. What kind of evidence might show this? I could look for evidence that ancient apes had primitive versions of some features humans have and that over time, later species of apes developed versions of these features that are ever closer to the version of those features shared by humans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, I could look at the skull of some very ancient apes. I might notice that these skulls have brain cases larger than some of their earlier relatives. These brain cases are larger than some other human relatives. However, their brain cases are not as large as the brain cases possessed by human skulls. I may then notice that later species of apes have still larger brain cases. And later generations have still larger brain cases than that. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And so on, so that the closer these species get to humans in time, the larger the brain cases possessed by these apes and the more human like their brain cases are. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What would this show? It suggests that as time progresses, that the successive species of apes are becoming more and more like humans in terms of their brain cases. We can say the same about other skeletal structures and parts of their genome! We can show that over time, we see apes that are developing increasingly human-like pelvises, for instance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26308,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"media"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucySkull.jpg"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucySkull.jpg" alt="Skull of an ancient pre-human ape." class="wp-image-26308"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">There is much evidence that man evolved from other apes. Evidence such as this Australopithecus skull.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, it seems possible that man evolved from an ape! I have not simply asserted that it is so because I imagine it is so. I have concluded that it might be so, based on some evidence that seems to suggest this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Am I certain of this? No, I might not be. I might think that this is not very conclusive yet. However, I have some reason, based on evidence, to think that it might be true. I have a <em>basis</em> for my belief that man evolved from these earlier species of apes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, in the modern age, we have now proven beyond all rational doubt humans did indeed evolve from other apes and that humans are still apes! We have so much evidence for this that it would be perverse to suggest that we did not evolve from apes. Sadly, this does not stop millions of Creationists from asserting that we did not evolve from apes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, suppose that I simply declare that man evolved from apes. Suppose that I have no evidence of any kind to suggest that this is true. I just assert that it is so because I simply believe it to be so, based on faith.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is speculation. It is not the same as establishing that something is possible. You have no reason, no evidence, to believe it might be true. One cannot base an argument solely on speculation. Then you have simply asserted it on faith.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:nextpage -->
<!--nextpage-->
<!-- /wp:nextpage -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Asserting that something is true in the absence of evidence is taking it on faith that it is true. That is what faith is, choosing to believe something for no reason. Asserting that evolution happens but having no evidence for it would be just as much an exercise in faith as asserting that God exists. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="htoc-the-fact-that-it-happens-to-be-true-does-not-mean-that-you-have-established-its-possibility">That evolution is true does not mean that you have established the truth or that it is possible until you have evidence for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="htoc-just-because-a-claim-is-true-does-not-mean-it-is-possible-in-the-absence-of-evidence">Just because a claim is true does not mean you have established that it is  true or possible in the absence of evidence.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, you would have no reason to think it is true. The theory of evolution has always described reality, but until I discover evidence for it, nobody had any reason to consider it to be possibly true. <br><br>You have not established something as possible until you provide evidence that it is so. Even if your claim is true, until you do this, you have not established that it is possible and it is baseless speculation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, when Darwin presented his theory of evolution by natural selection in the <em><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1228/1228-h/1228-h.htm" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1228/1228-h/1228-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Origin of Species</a></em>, he presented a lot of evidence, thus establishing that his theory was not only possible, but by far the most likely explanation for the observed phenomena.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For something to be possible, you must have a reason, based on evidence, to think that it is so.&nbsp;It also has to not contradict known facts, as we shall see in a moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to this definition of “possible”, it is not true that “anything is possible”. Unless you can establish a reason to believe something is true, it is has not been established as possible. Nothing is possible until there is the slightest bit of evidence that shows that it is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You cannot say that it is "possible" that you can walk to the Sun. There is no reason to think that this is possible. As we shall soon see, we have good reason to think that this is <em>impossible</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="what-counts-as-evidence">What Counts as Evidence?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What would qualify as evidence? Either some perceptual fact or conceptual argument would qualify.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A perceptual fact would be some directly observable fact, something you can observe directly via sight or one of the other senses. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suppose that you want evidence that there is such a thing as an emu. Going out and seeing an emu would be pretty good perceptual evidence that emus are real! Or suppose that you want evidence that Jupiter has more than one moon. Well, you can observe that yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conceptual evidence are facts that support a claim which are not directly observable by the senses. <br><br>Suppose that I was to say that Musk cannot fit his full crew of 100 onto the Starship. What evidence could I provide for this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26318,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"is-style-default"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MuskPublicDomainSmaller.jpg" alt="Elon Musk" class="wp-image-26318"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photos of the Post Launch Press Conference after a successful launch of SpaceX CRS-8 and successful landing of the Falcon 9 rocket on the barge.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could wait to see if he builds it and then wait to see if he tries to put a crew of 100 on it and watch this fail. We can directly observe this, and this might be another example of perceptual evidence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We do not have to wait for Musk to fail to get a crew of 100 onto his Starship. Instead, we can provide conceptual evidence that this is not workable. How can we do this? Let me show how this might be done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Starship has a payload capacity of 220,000 pounds. However, we can show that the amount of food and water required for a crew of 100 would be roughly 260,000 pounds. <br><br>Therefore, the weight of food and water for a crew of 100 would exceed the payload capacity of Starship. This is interesting conceptual evidence that the Starship cannot feasibly support a crew of 100 as proposed at the time of writing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take essentially any mathematical theorem. Let us take a simple one, like the Pythagoras Theorem. Here is the equation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup></code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This theorem relates all three sides of a right-angled triangle. It says that the sums of the squares of the two shorter sides equal the square of the third, longest side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Can you provide perceptual evidence for this? You could observe a lot of right-angled triangles and you should find that this holds. How would you know that this holds for all right-angled triangles?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You would use mathematical facts that we know to be true and use those facts to prove that the Pythagoras Theorem applies to all triangles and not just the ones we have measured. We can show this conceptually, using mathematical concepts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pythagoras-1.jpg" alt="Pythagoras of Samos" class="wp-image-26316"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pythagoras was a great mathematician, but a terrible philosopher, as we shall eventually see.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="the-impossible">The Impossible</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lots of things are not established as possible and cannot be so.&nbsp;No evidence has ever been given to support the truth of such claims.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Note that all gods fall into this category. Noone has ever provided valid evidence for any god. Since supernatural entities allegedly supersede nature, they will never provide such evidence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We shall also see that not only has the possibility of any god not been established, their impossibility can be definitively proven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="htoc-if-you-can-establish-if-x-was-true-it-would-contradict-a-known-fact-then-x-cannot-be-possible">If you can establish that if X was true, it would contradict a known fact, then X cannot be possible.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There cannot be any contradictions in reality. Nothing that is true contradicts something else that is true. If you know Y is true, but X contradicts Y, then X is impossible. Thus, its possibility obviously cannot be established.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s say that I wish to establish that man is a dinosaur. As you know, dinosaurs lay eggs and do not bear live young. They also do not feed their young milk using mammary glands. However, humans bear live young and feed their young using mammary glands, just like other mammals!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Humans also have hair, and no dinosaur has hair! In addition, humans also replace their teeth only one time while dinosaurs have no such limitation. Humans also have diaphragms, something only mammals possess and certainly not dinosaurs. Humans have three bones in the middle ear, which is a diagnostic feature of a mammal and a feature no dinosaur could possess. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:nextpage -->
<!--nextpage-->
<!-- /wp:nextpage -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it goes on like this. We can identify several features of humans that no dinosaur could share. These facts show that man is a mammal and, therefore, cannot be a dinosaur.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, if a man was a dinosaur, this would contradict the known fact that man is mammal. Not only is there no evidence that man is a dinosaur, no such evidence could exist. The possibility of man being a dinosaur has therefore not been established.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can go beyond saying that it has not been established as possible for man to be a dinosaur, we can say that it is impossible for man to be a dinosaur!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A claim is impossible when:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="htoc-a-claim-has-not-been-established-as-possible-and-the-evidence-contradicts-it">A claim has not been established as possible, and the evidence contradicts it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="htoc-that-which-contradicts-with-any-known-fact-of-reality-is-impossible">That which contradicts any known fact of reality is impossible. </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you make a claim that would require something to contradict its nature or which otherwise contradicts known facts of reality, then you are making an absurd claim of impossibility. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gods always seem to be defined as immortal entities with supernatural and magical abilities. As supernatural abilities are a synonym for magic, a being with magical abilities. It is easy to see that no being could be immortal or possess such reality-defying abilities. Therefore, any god qua magical being is by its supposed nature, is impossible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can thus say it is impossible for any such Creator God to exist. Therefore, it is impossible for him to have created the universe. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26317,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"is-style-default"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CreatorGod-1.jpg" alt="God in the clouds." class="wp-image-26317"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hey God, go away, nobody asked you!</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is there a difference between "not established as possible" and "impossible"? Yes, there is, and it is an important distinction. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you say, "not established as possible", you are pointing out that no possibility has been established. You are saying that nobody has given you a reason to take that claim seriously. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, when you say that something is impossible, this is not the same thing. You are not saying that the claim lacks any evidence, and that there is no reason to take it seriously. You are saying that the impossible claim is definitively false because of its clash with some aspect of reality. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suppose that I say that "evolution happens" but I have no evidence for it. That means that evolution has not been established as possible. Since I have not shown that it is possible. However, that does not mean that it is impossible and cannot happen. Only that I have not established the possibility that it happens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why is any of this important? Why can't we just say that the possible are those things that occur to us and are possible if we have not shown that they are impossible?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because there is no cognitive value in entertaining ideas which have no provable connection to the facts of reality. Such a thought or statement might as well not be said, as it has no cognitive value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The arbitrary is worse than the false. If you make a false statement such as "I am a pink unicorn", then it can be shown that you are not a pink unicorn. You are not a horse and you certainly do not have a magical horn. So, it is clearly impossible for you to be a pink unicorn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suppose that you assert that the first house on some random street in Sri Lanka has a psychedelic rainbow android. Assume that we have no way to verify this information. This is a completely arbitrary statement with no demonstrable connection to reality. In the absence of any evidence, there is no way to know whether this is possible or impossible or true or false. It might be true. Who knows? If we cannot check the house or otherwise find out if it has a psychedelic rainbow android. in it, we have no way to know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How can we conclude anything about this claim? We can't prove it true or false until we go there or communicate with this household, so until then there is no point thinking about it at all. At least if we knew it was false, we might do something with that fact. Sometimes knowing something is false is useful because at least you can rule one thing out. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is one reason we should distinguish claims which have not shown to be possible from those shown to be impossible. The arbitrary is neither possible or impossible. We should distinguish arbitrary claims from impossible claims. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just because the possibility of a claim has not been established, that does not make the claim impossible. Suppose that Charles Darwin had just asserted evolution happens. However, suppose that he presented no evidence. That does not mean evolution does not or cannot happen. It would just mean that we would have no reason to take Darwin's claim seriously. A lack of evidence that something is true is not evidence that it is false.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="17ba">The only claims of any merit are those that help us achieve some value in the world. That claim might be to understand how to deal with the world around you and stay alive. It might be how to get lots of money and buy that house you want.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="17ba">Whatever the case is, for a claim to be of worth, it must help us achieve some purpose in the real world. If not, of what use could it possibly be to anyone?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To achieve values, we must deal with the world as it really is. We must understand how the world works and deal with reality as it is. That it is only that which helps us do this, that can help us achieve values.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, in order to help us achieve values in the real world, a claim must have a valid relation to the world. It must have some relation to observable facts. If not, then it is impossible for it to have any real merit. That which has no relation to the real world is useless in achieving values.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, if we are going to make or evaluate claims about reality, the only ones that are of any use in achieving values are those that correspond with reality.<br><br>Truth is the correspondence with reality. Truth is that which corresponds to the way things are. Therefore, the only claim that has any merit is that which can be said to have some truth to it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do we know whether a claim is true? Its possibility must first be established. If we make a claim, we should establish that there is some evidence or proof behind it. Any assertion accepted in the absence of evidence cannot be established to correspond to reality and is, therefore, entirely without merit.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the transcript of an interview with my friend Narendra Kumar on the issue of science education. We discussed many things, including the difficulties of learning physics, problems with concretization, the role of mathematics and its relationship with science, the beauty of the science and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I answered some of the questions he prepared in advance and he offered several insightful clarifying questions and commentary. It was a very good interview and we covered a lot of ground in about seventy minute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was supposed to be a livestream available on YouTube. However there were severe audio issues and much of the audio is unusable. However, I have created this transcript without losing anything significant from the original discussion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At a later date I will present an audio reading of this interview which is mostly my answers but with several of Narendra's insightful comments. For now, you have this transcript.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I trust that you will find this interesting and informative. The transcript is available below as a PDF, please <a href="http://localhost/rational/transcripts/MetaphysicsOfPhysicsInterviewWithNarendra.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="http://localhost/rational/transcripts/MetaphysicsOfPhysicsInterviewWithNarendra.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here download it</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dwayne</strong>: Okay. Hi everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Metaphysics of Physics.<br><strong><br>Narendra:</strong> Hi.<br><br>Today I have my friend Narendra with us from India, via the magic of the internet. Say hi to our audience.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Hello everybody!<br><strong><br>Dwayne:</strong> He teaches English studies. And he likes to use holistic education methods. And he has a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering and an MSc in Economics.<br><br>We are going to learn about some issues in science and science education. We'll be focusing on physics, but a lot of other branches of science, particularly mathematics, will come up as well. Narendra has given me lots of good questions beforehand.<br><strong><br>Narendra:</strong> Yeah, they've already given. And so, thank you, Dwayne, I would like to say something.<br><br>I am happy that I've come on live with you. I've been watching your posts and the way you over-explain. I really love that. So, I thought we'll connect, and thanks for agreeing to that.<br><br>And thanks also for the fantastic preparation you have done. Because I gave these questions much earlier, almost, I think two weeks back. And he wrote the answers down. So that's very unique. People don't do that.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>Well, I like to be prepared.<br><br><strong>Narendra: </strong>Yeah, I know, I know. I'd like to tell the audience that these questions have already been given. So, there's no need for me to ask them. He will be telling the question.<br><br>And I will be adding things. If I think that there is anything if I feel a general audience needs it. If they need some clarification or if I need some clarification, I'll butt in. But I would like Dwayne to talk.Dwayne: Yes.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Okay, then we go ahead.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>Okay, let's get started with the first question. And this question is whether it is difficult to learn physics. And here's what I have to say on that.<br><br>Now, of course, physics is a very fundamental subject. Some people might have the idea that this should make it easy, but I do not think that should be the case. Fundamental is not the same as easy.<br><br>The subject matter of physics is essentially all of physical reality. You can take the view that that is looking out at all of physical reality and seeing how all of this works. Basically, everything that is physical is something to do with physics.<br><br>But in practice, this is not actually easy. Once you start doing physics, you will very quickly find that you need math, lots of math, to do much of anything.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hard-math.jpg" alt="Complicated math." class="wp-image-26413"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is not where physics stops. It where it should really get going ...</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Narendra:</strong> Yes.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> You need to be able to quantify the things like velocity, and acceleration and forces and how forces lead to motion and stuff. You need mathematics to identify, quantify, understand all these relationships. We will go into the role of math in a later question, and so we won't go into that too<br>much now.<br><br><strong>Narendra: </strong>Yeah.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> But the math can get really complicated, really fast. And not everyone is good at math. Certainly not in my experience. It is a very abstract subject, and it's very difficult for some, even if it is taught properly. And in my experience, it seldom is.<br><br>Add to that the fact that you're dealing with some very abstract things like energy. We don't know what energy is really and Feynman himself said we don't know. And he was one of the greatest physicists of his time.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> He did not know; you can imagine it was undefined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Yeah, that was a perfectly valid point. So, in other words, energy is not easy to intuitively grasp. And then there's light. We don't know what light really is. They say it's a particle and a wave. But, well, no.<br><br>Even trying to visualize an atom can be hard. Remember the show the Big Bang Theory? You have that picture of the electrons orbiting the nucleus like little moons.<br><br>This is an okay way of visualizing an atom. It is good enough for high school physics, maybe first-year college physics. But according to quantum physics, this is wrong. But how do we visualize it?<br><strong><br>Narendra:</strong> Exactly.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>We don't know, quantum physics has not given us an answer. It doesn't give us any answers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, you could say that the subject matter of physics is non-trivial to understand. It can get quite abstract. But there is another problem.<br><br>Many of the problems of modern physics make this a lot harder than it should be. You see, there is a "shut up and calculate" approach that is widely taken.<br><br><strong>Narendra: </strong>Shut and calculate.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Yeah.<br><br><strong>Narendra: </strong>Shut up and calculate. Yeah, that is funny. Shut up and calculate.<br><br>Dwayne: Yes, exactly. That is an exact quote, although I cannot remember who said it offhand.<br><br><strong>Narendra: </strong>Oh, my.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:nextpage -->
<!--nextpage-->
<!-- /wp:nextpage -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dwayne:</strong> With the advent of quantum physics, physicists have largely given up on the attempt to present physical theories which can be connected to observable reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Indeed, when it comes to the things they talk about, like atoms and electrons and photons and stuff, they do not believe that reality is not knowable.<br><br>In fact, a lot of physicists will tell you that the microscopic world, the atomic world is not knowable. And maybe the rest of the world is also not knowable. They talk about electrons not really having definite properties. They say that a photon, that light, is both a wave and a particle. And other nonsense.<br><br>This is just a projection of anti-realist epistemology, of their philosophy. As if reality is fundamentally unknowable. But that is not true. You can't justify that, even though they will try to use quantum mechanics to justify the philosophy they've already assumed.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Exactly.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> They will say, oh, that physics is fundamental and not philosophy and that philosophy just has to give way to physics. But that is not how it works.<br><br>But Bohr and the like, they were a bit more honest. They kind of admitted that philosophy was the motivation. But physicists of today do not want to admit this.<br><br>So instead of dealing with reality, which they do not believe that you can know anyway, they came up with a lot of mathematics. And they stopped there. That shut up and calculate thing. The mathematics is all they offered. You have to be able to somehow understand it without being able to tie it to tangible, understandable physical reality. Take string theory, it is all about little strings on a quantum scale.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Little strings and they pull the strings.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stringPuppets.jpg" alt="Puppet on strings." class="wp-image-26415"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">String theory is like a puppet show?</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Ha! What are the strings? What? Are there any physical, real things? What do they represent? No, I don't know. It's just a bunch of really complicated math. What does it mean? Who knows? Does it describe observable physical objects?<br><br>Not that I can tell. Not that anyone can tell. They say: well, it is our best guess. Take our word for it, it works! It works, even though they can't make any predictions!<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Yeah, it works? How does it work? Hahaha!<br><br>Dwayne: They cannot even make any predictions. So, what use of it? Not that science is all about making predictions. It is about understanding the world. But they think if they can predict things, then that is just as good. But that's not what science is about.<br><br>Anyway, none of this gets us closer to understanding how the physical world actually works. And it just makes people think that physics is not about the world. As if it describes some Platonic mathematical universe. Who wants to do that? No sane person, I think.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> What you are saying, Dwayne, is that it need not be this difficult?<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>It should not be this difficult, no. It should not be this difficult. If we have understandable mathematics, then we can take the mathematics and figure out what it is talking about<br><br>If we could look at real objects, if we could understand what it is what the mathematics was really telling us, we might be able to understand any of it. It wouldn't just be a bunch of equations, a bunch of math, which is basically all string theory is.<br><br>Instead, they just memorize a bunch of meaningless mathematical equations that we cannot tie back to reality.<br><br>But let's suppose that we fixed all of this. Let's suppose we tied physics back to reality. Made all of this rational again. Is all of this going to become easy? Is all of this going to be something you can master in high school? I don't think so. I just do not think it will ever be an easy subject, at least not for everyone.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Even if you make it all connected to reality, it takes a little longer time to get the facts together.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Yeah, there's a lot of complicated abstractions like energy. Even if we knew what energy is, it's a very high-level concept, I suspect. Okay, energy is defined as the ability to do work. But what does that mean? We don't know. But, but even that's kind of a high-level abstraction.<br><br>And there were things like atoms and if we had a rational quantum theory it is still a quite long involved chain of knowledge required to really understand how this works.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Narendra:</strong> The chain is long, even if you connect it to reality, the chain has to be gone through, step by step.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Yeah, it is a very complicated subject.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> And the physics is very abstract, yes.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> And there is still the complicated math. I do not think that all of the complicated math is just going to go away. We might be able to understand it, but you still have to learn a lot of complicated math.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Basic math and then higher math and still higher math...<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Calculus, group theory, all kinds of complicated math.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Differential equations.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Differential equations, yeah. My wife majored in physics. She did, I don't know like half a dozen different math papers or more.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Half a dozen courses on mathematics so you can imagine how really complex physical reality be.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> And I think she did two different papers on differential equations. And that is before we get to the really hard stuff, which string theory is made up of.<br><br>I think if we got rid of string theory, we could get rid of a lot of this crazy mess. But the main point is that even if we fixed physics, made it rational again, I think it would be a pretty complicated subject There is still a lot of math and a long... a long...<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Chain of reasoning, right?<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>I think yeah, I think it's always going to be somewhat difficult for some people. And I think that makes sense.<br><br>Even if you look up say only 19th-century physics, say Maxwell's equations. They take some differential equations and methods to really understand that. I don't know about four different math courses to understand Maxwell's equations properly. A couple of calculus papers, a couple of differential equations papers. Lots of math any way you put it.</p>

<p>This is an interview with the Objectivist computer scientist Martin Johansen.  We discussed his lecture "Charles Babbage: Induction in Computer Science". You can and should purchase a copy of <a href="https://estore.aynrand.org/products/charles-babbage-induction-in-computer-science-mp3-download?_pos=1&amp;_sid=74692a7ab&amp;_ss=r" data-type="URL" data-id="https://estore.aynrand.org/products/charles-babbage-induction-in-computer-science-mp3-download?_pos=1&amp;_sid=74692a7ab&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this lecture here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-introduction">Introduction </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a great introduction to the role of induction in science in general, not just computer science. Although, of course, we covered a lot of computer science topics as well. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should find this instructive and interesting even if you are not an expert on computer science or philosophy. Martin explains very clearly what induction is, why it is important and how it can be used in computer science and other fields. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also discussed some of why it is dismissed today. As well as the irrational way modern academics such as Turing approach the field of computer science.<br><br>Here is the list of questions I prepared when asking him. I did not go very far off script. It gives you a pretty good idea of what we discussed. </p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="questions-on-computer-science">Questions on Computer Science</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is your background in computer science and philosophy?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is a computer and what is the origin of this this term?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why did you choose to get into computer science?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may have noticed that many Objectivists are into programming, why do you think that is?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is induction?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why is induction important? Also, why do you think so many people either don’t think about it or think that it is as impotent as they do?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why do you think induction is so dismissed today?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How is a computer so useful in showing the immense power of induction?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who was Charles Babbage?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What were some of his more interesting ideas?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What were the Difference and Analytical Engines? Do any of these machines qualify as a computer?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why did he consider such machines so important in his time?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why  were his machines not more widely employed in his time?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who was Ada Lovelace and why do you suppose so few people know that name?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We might talk about this another time, but in the lecture you talk about the work of Francis Bacon. Do you think his work is relevant today?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Briefly, how might you use induction to invent something new, such as a computer?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tell me about some of the philosophical ideas that are implicitly or explicitly held by many in this field today. In particular, talk about the influence of Bertrand Russell and his, let's say, disciple, Alan Turning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How does the philosophical ideas of Turing compare to Babbage?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What about their ideas on computers? How do they differ?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are your thoughts on the Turing Test. Does it really have any useful implications when it comes to AI?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are the fundamental philosophical errors committed by the concept of the Turing Machine? Is the Turing Machine of any practical purpose or any other valid purpose?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tell us about what you call the “Disproof by arbitrary counterexamples” thing you mention in the lecture and the consequences of this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tell us about the difference between the views of Babbage and Turing when it comes to man’s mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is the problem with mechanical materialism and does this have any implications to AI?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What about the Halting problem? Even when I studied this in college, before learning about Objectivism, I could not understand how this was valid. It clearly does not apply to real computers, only to Turing’s arbitrary theoretical computer. Right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is the analytic/synthetic dichotomy and how does it apply here?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are some of the consequences of Turing’s ideas and its influence on computer science?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You have a good list of sources on your personal website. I will include a link to it in the description of this video. But are there any books or sources that you would like to to mention right now?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ok, so are there any other comments you would like? Would you like to present a quick summary?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gaede and I discuss the problems in modern physics, some of the many ways in which physics is irrational, the improper conflation of mathematics with physics, his rope model and more.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problems he mentions are largely centered around the idea that we do not have physicists anymore, we have mathematicians. People that try to describe but not explain how this universe works. But, physics is meant to be about explaining how the universe works!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is where the rope model comes in. It offers an explanation of light, electromagnetism, gravity and more. Gaede discusses this in some depth in his book "Why God Does Not Exist".</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dwayne: </strong>Okay, we'll start with the first and most obvious question, what is physics? You have talked about the Golden Principle of physics. Tell us about that as well.<br><br><strong>Gaede:</strong> Yeah, well, the Golden Principle.<br><br>First, physics is not the study of this or the study of that. Anybody can study and not be able to explain anything in science, let alone physics. But science is not just the study of something. It's explaining something, especially as regards to physics. You must explain physical mechanisms, causes. That's what I think physics is about.<br><br>In order to explain causes, you need to have objects. And I think the bread and butter of physics is this word called object. And to me, it's stunning that no one has figured this out in mathematical physics.<br><br>Since the days of Newton, at least, no one has figured out that you need an object to do physics. Once you cover that stuff, you got to define the word object. And no one has defined the word object in a scientific way.<br><br>Not a single physics textbook on planet Earth begins by saying: “This is an object and this is what we're going to do with it”.<br><br>In other words, specifically defined keywords that you need for the foundations of physics. This is an object, this is distance, this is a location. This is what we mean by motion. These words have never been defined in a scientific way.<br><br>In fact, Newton said he didn't know what motion was. And so, yes, I think physics is the study of causes and mechanism. It's not about math, it's not about measuring and it's not about equations.<br><br>It's about explaining a mechanism. You want to explain how a magnet works; you want to explain how gravity works.<br><br>In order to do that, you need objects and you need to define what an object is. So, in a nutshell, is my vision of physics.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Okay, so how would you define an object?<br><br><strong>Gaede:</strong> Well, you know, if you look in the dictionary, you'll find definitions of ordinary speech, not scientific definitions. In other words, not ones that you can use consistently, rationally.In order to use that word consistently, scientifically, rationally, you have to define it as that which has shape. That's the only property all objects have, whether imaginary objects or real objects. All of them have the<br>same property, shape.<br><br>And what doesn't have shape as known as a concept, essentially.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>Right, I agree. What is mathematics? And how does it relate to physical objects? For instance, how do numbers relate to physical objects?<br><br><strong>Gaede:</strong> I love the question. No, I'm saying mathematics has nothing to do with physics or with science. And people immediately say: “Why? No, you're crazy. What do you mean, mathematics has nothing to do with science?”<br><br>We go back to the definitions and just follow them strictly. What is science about? What is physics about? Physics is about explaining phenomena, causes and mechanisms. We have no use for mathematics whatsoever.<br><br>So, in that sense, mathematics has absolutely nothing to do with physics or with science. If physics is about explaining causes and mechanisms<br><br>Obviously, if you define physics as measurement, equations, predictions, observation, proof evidence, well, then yeah, then you can bring mathematics in.<br><br>What's happened is that the mathematicians have defined what science, what physics is, not the physicists. And a real genuine physicist defines physics a little differently than a mathematician. He views it as causes and mechanisms. For that, we have no use whatsoever for mathematics.<br><br>What does an equation do? Equations are just a description. And I'm not asking for a description. I'm asking for an explanation.<br><br>And for that, you need to define the words “explain” and “describe” and find out what the difference between those two words is. But a lot of people think they're synonyms.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>Okay, so how would you describe these words and the difference between them?<br><br><strong>Gaede:</strong> Well, a description is a listing of properties. Say that I want to describe a chair. I say it's got four legs, it's brown, it's big, it's small. I use adjectives and I qualify it. All I'm doing is describing. I haven't explained anything so far.<br><br>An explanation is revealing causes and mechanisms for phenomena. And saying that there was something which happened. You are going to say how it happened.<br><br>Meaning, not a description like “It fell down and it fell at 9.8 meters per second squared”.<br><br>No, that's not an explanation. You want to know what caused it to fall down and not up, for example. Or how does one magnet attract another?<br><br>I can't just say, well, it attracts at such and such speed at such and such distance. That's not an explanation. That's just the description.<br><br>What I want is an experience. I want to know the mechanism. If I want to explain to you the mechanism, then I can use the following example, because I guess everybody can relate to it.<br><br>You have a pulley and you have a bucket. You have a rope tied to the bucket and the rope goes around the pulley, the little wheel. And you say well, how did he put the bucket up there? It was full of water, and how do you put the butter bucket up there?<br><br>I show the movie and I don't even have to explain anything. I can just show the movie. All the objects are all visible. And you see this guy pulls on the rope, the rope goes around the pulley, the wheel turns and the bucket goes up.<br><br>So, everybody looks at that and they say, I understand how the bucket ended up there, he just pulled down on the rope.<br><br>And that is a mechanism everybody can understand. Because everything is visible in front of your very own eyes. And so, all you have to do is watch the movie and say, “I understand the mechanism”.<br><br>But we don't do that with magnets. We don't do that with gravity, we don't do that with light or with atomic behavior. We don't do that with electricity.<br><br>What we say there oh, let me describe it for you. And in the case of gravity, they say mass. And mass is a concept, it is a mathematical concept. I can't say mass did this or mass did that. It is like saying the weight of an elephant did this. The weight of an elephant squashed the ant.<br><br>No, it was the foot of the elephant that squashed the ant, not the weight. Weight has no power to do anything. Weight is a mathematical concept.<br><br>Likewise, mass is a mathematical concept. And you can't say energy did this or that either, because that's another mathematical concept.<br><br>The problem we have today is that we use these words like field, force and time. But nobody has defined these terms, which are obvious concepts.<br><br>And they use them as if they were physical objects. They tell you that time has warped. And they tell you that they sent energy, that they transferred energy. They say that they moved the mass. That the force<br>was strong, it was a very strong force. And so forth.<br><br>And so, we're using all these concepts as physical objects. We have gotten so used to it because they're all mathematical concepts. And its mathematicians who have defined science, not physicists.<br><br>In fact, if you go back to square one, we go back to Aristotle, he's the guy who wrote the first book of physics that we have today. The first extant book of physics. That's his eponymous book known as “Physics”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aristotle says, look, mathematicians do angles, numbers, that's mathematicians. Physicists, they do causes.<br><br>And a lot of people criticize this and they say “Well, Bill, you want to go back to the days of Aristotle”.<br><br>But you must understand the context. The context is not that we want to go back to Aristotle in the sense that maybe his scientific method was to be desired. The issue is that he had the right idea, physics explains causes. That's what we forgot.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with people doing experiments. There's nothing wrong with people doing math if they want. But when they come to the conference, they have to explain the mechanism. And that's what they forgot about.<br><br>They do a lot of math, they have a lot of descriptions, equations, numbers., they talk about infinity. They bring in all these fancy words like energy and field. And what we're missing is the explanation of the mechanism.We still don't know how one magnet attracts another. Or how gravity works. And this is the issue.<br><br>That's why I go back to Aristotle only in the context of that business about causes and mechanisms.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today we have an interview with Warren Fahy, author of the books Fragment and Pandemonium. We are going to talk about these books as well as about some biology stuff. Should be fun!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of you may not know what these books are. Well, Warren is going to tell us all about them in a little bit. But they are science thrillers something along the lines of Jurassic Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can probably gather by the fact that I am interviewing him about these books, that I have read them and probably enjoy them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, I have read them and I do enjoy them. Fragment and the sequel are amazingly interesting books with some extremely compelling biological theories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are some truly terrifying, nightmare creatures in both of them. They make the dinosaurs and monsters in other books seem tame. Dragons? T-Rexes? The critters in these books, such as spigers are much deadlier and scarier.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also quite like the main cast of characters, but I cannot talk about that very much without spoilers. But two of them are biologists and they may or may not have some fascinating biological ideas, new and old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Highly recommended. But more than that and as entertaining as the scary monsters are, you might also learn something reading this.</p>

So that was the kind of book I decided I wanted to write.Since I was a kid, I've been writing. </p>

<p>And I have been studying evolution ever since I dug a fossil out of the hills behind my grandparent’s home when I was eight. Ever since then I've been fascinated by evolution. And so, I decided to mine that avenue for a thriller.<br><br>I hadn't really seen anyone ever deal with the concept of a completely separate evolution that was isolated and went off in a completely different direction. Resulting in an entire ecosystem of almost alien creatures. If you went back far enough, I figured you could make a very compelling world.<br><br>And so, Fragment is a story of a fragment of an ancient super-continent that had been isolated for 550 million years. And which was lost in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean in the middle of the Roaring Forties. Which is a current that ships try to avoid in their shipping routes.<br><br>I decided to put a reality TV show that is circumnavigating the world, in the path of this island. And what they discover, of course, is an alien world. Such a dangerous world that they're almost all slaughtered on live television as they land.<br><br>And this calls attention to the United States government. The Navy isolates the island and sends in a team of scientists to find out what in the world is going on.<br><br>And what they discover is a world that if any of the species from it were to escape, and get to the rest of the world, it would be only a matter of time before they knocked out the legs from every single ecosystem on planet Earth. And so, that's the premise of Fragment.<br><br>Pandemonium is the sequel. It has some of the survivors moving on to yet another ecosystem that has been isolated in a giant cave system under the Ural Mountains in a fictitious country.<br><br>And within that cave system, the former Soviet Union has built a gigantic city from which to escape any possible pandemonium from any kind of worldwide nuclear conflagration.<br><br>And so, then we discover an entirely different universe of creatures. We discover an ecosystem that descended not Cambrian era like Fragment but descended from the Devonian.<br><br>One in which the ecosystem is chiefly mostly molluscs instead of arthropods, like the Cambrian era descendants. And so, we once again we have another entire menu of crazy monster animals to deal with.So those are the two science-heavy books and they incorporate a lot of different new theories and required a lot of interesting research.<br><br>Dwayne: Well, that fossil you dug up when you were eight, did you ever find out what it was?<br><br>Warren: I did, it was just one leaf from a fern. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And my uncle was a geophysicist. And he identified it for me. He had collected a lot of trilobites from a nearby quarry and that had those really fired my imagination.<br><br>So, many years later, I would write Fragment about a world that had descended from that era, the era of trilobites. But what if they had gone off on their own way separate from everything else on planet Earth? What would they look like half a billion years later?<br><br>Dwayne: Hmm, OK. Now we can talk about some of the science ideas in the book. Tell us about some of those.<br><br>Warren: Well, since I've been studying evolution since I was a kid, I have been sort of a like an armchair biologist. I have always been endlessly fascinated by the process of evolution.<br><br>And three theories along the way occurred to me while I was studying various aspects of evolution. Two such theories are presented in Fragment and they are original theories.<br><br>One of them has gotten some interest from some actual geneticists who are studying lifespan. And that particular theory the theory of lifespan describes what dictates the lifespan of all species on Earth.<br><br>It was, basically, derived from looking at barnacles. And barnacles are something that fascinated Darwin to no end. They are amazing creatures which people don't seem to really understand.<br><br>They are crustaceans like crabs or lobsters. And they're obviously the weirdest crustacean on earth. And they only live for about two years. But mussels, that live right next to them, have almost an unlimited lifespan. They can live up to 70 years.<br><br>So, I was thinking, why in the world, would these two species have such a vastly different lifespan? And as I studied it, I realized that there was a difference between the way they procreate.Of course, mussels procreate by this huge bloom of sex cells that they all release all at the same time. Trillions of cells that drift in a cloud and end up creating the next generation.<br><br>Barnacles, however, have the largest sexual member in proportion to body size of any animal on earth. They must procreate by literally reaching it over to the next neighbor next to it in order to inseminate<br>that neighbor. That is how they create the next generation.<br><br>So that was a clue and the fact that they reach sexual maturity in one year and die. The fact that they die by the time their offspring reach sexual maturity was a giant clue.<br><br>Of course, all species on Earth become unable to procreate if they mate with their offspring. And there are all kinds of different reasons and biological barriers that stop that from happening.<br><br>And if they didn't stop that from happening, then that species would die out in very short order. Even plants that procreate with their own offspring will become unable to procreate in only two or three<br>generations.<br><br>So, as I started to check this theory out by looking at animals and plants with lifespans, I found that the theory held true with absolutely every species across the board. Any animal that could theoretically,<br>crossbreed with their own offspring had a fixed lifespan at twice the age of sexual maturity. So that they could not compete with the next generation and mate with their own offspring.<br><br>And this is true from everything from redwoods and sequoias, to whales and to any species, you can name. But certain species get around it without lifespan, because they don't need it.<br><br>For instance, the sequoia has made the same way that mussels do. Or the coral reefs do with giant clouds of sex sells that are all released at once. And the chances of them breeding with their own offspring are so slim that they're infinitesimal. They are vanishingly small.<br><br>If you look at something like some whales, they congregate in giant groups and they don't meet for life or anything. They just randomly mix in and they meet several times a year and that makes it impossible for them.</p>

<p>Today we have an interview with Warren Fahy, author of the books Fragment and Pandemonium. We are going to talk about these books as well as about some biology stuff. Should be fun!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of you may not know what these books are. Well, Warren is going to tell us all about them in a little bit. But they are science thrillers something along the lines of Jurassic Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can probably gather by the fact that I am interviewing him about these books, that I have read them and probably enjoy them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, I have read them and I do enjoy them. Fragment and the sequel are amazingly interesting books with some extremely compelling biological theories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are some truly terrifying, nightmare creatures in both of them. They make the dinosaurs and monsters in other books seem tame. Dragons? T-Rexes? The critters in these books, such as spigers are much deadlier and scarier.</p>

<p>I also quite like the main cast of characters, but I cannot talk about that very much without spoilers. But two of them are biologists and they may or may not have some fascinating biological ideas, new and old.</p>

<p><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Hello, welcome to episode twenty-five of the Metaphysics of Physics podcast.<br><br>I am Dwayne Davies, your occasional host. Today we are going to interview Warren Fahy, the author of the bestselling books Fragment and Pandemonium.<br><br>Some of you may not know what these books are. Well, Warren is going to tell us all about them in a little bit. But they are science thriller something along the lines of Jurassic Park.<br><br>You can probably gather by the fact that I am interviewing him about these books, that I have read them and probably enjoy them. Yes, I have read them and I do enjoy them.<br><br>Fragment and the sequel are amazingly interesting books with some extremely compelling biological theories.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are some truly terrifying, nightmare creatures in both of them. They make the dinosaurs and monsters in other books seem tame. Dragons? T-Rexes? The critters in these books, such as spigers are<br>much deadlier and scarier.<br><br>I also quite like the main cast of characters, but I cannot talk about that very much without spoilers. But two of them are biologists and they may or may not have some fascinating biological ideas, new and old.<br><br>Highly recommended. But more than that and as entertaining as the scary monsters are, you might also learn something reading this.<br><br>All right, now we have that out of the way, lets get back into things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alright, thank you for being here Warren.<br><br>Give us a brief introduction to Fragment and Pandemonium. Later questions will focus more on the science and the like, so maybe, for now, focus more on the theme and the plots.<br><br><strong>Warren:</strong> Perfect. Well, Fragment and Pandemonium are science thrillers. They are somewhat in the vein of Michael Crichton books,which happened to be my favorite kind of thriller.<br><br>I like to read a thriller, get something out of it, get some new information and to learn something. So that was the kind of book I decided I wanted to write.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since I was a kid, I've been writing. And I have been studying evolution since I dug a fossil out of the hills behind my grandparent’s home when I was eight. And ever since then I've been fascinated by evolution. So, I decided to mine that avenue for a thriller.<br><br>I hadn't really seen anyone ever deal with the concept of a completely separate evolution that was isolated and went off in a completely different direction. Resulting in an entire ecosystem of almost alien creatures. If you went back far enough, I figured you could make a very compelling world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:nextpage -->

<!-- /wp:nextpage -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And so, Fragment is a story of a fragment of an ancient super-continent that had been isolated for 550 million years. And which was lost in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean in the middle of the Roaring Forties. Which is a current that ships try to avoid in their shipping routes.<br><br>I decided to put a reality TV show that is circumnavigating the world, in the path of this island. And what they discover, of course, is an alien world. Such a dangerous world that they're almost all slaughtered on live television as they land.<br><br>And this calls attention to the United States government. The Navy isolates the island and sends in a team of scientists to find out what in the world is going on.<br><br>And what they discover is a world that if any of the species from it were to escape, and get to the rest of the world, it would be only a matter of time before they knocked out the legs from every single ecosystem on planet Earth. So, that's the premise of Fragment.<br><br>And Pandemonium is the sequel. It has some of the survivors moving on to yet another ecosystem that has been isolated in a giant cave system under the Ural Mountains in a fictitious country.<br><br>And within that cave system, the former Soviet Union has built a gigantic city from which to escape any possible pandemonium from any kind of worldwide nuclear conflagration.<br><br>And so, then we discover an entirely different universe of creatures. We discover an ecosystem that descended not Cambrian era like Fragment but descended from the Devonian.<br><br>One in which the ecosystem is chiefly mostly molluscs instead of arthropods, like the Cambrian era descendants. And so, we once again we have another entire menu of crazy monster animals to deal with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So those are the two science-heavy books and they incorporate a lot of different new theories and required a lot of interesting research.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Well, that fossil you dug up when you were eight, did you ever find out what it was?<br><strong><br>Warren:</strong> I did, it was just one leaf from a fern.<br><br>And my uncle was a geophysicist. And he identified it for me. He had collected a lot of trilobites from a nearby quarry and that had those really fired my imagination.<br><br>So, many years later, I would write Fragment about a world that had descended from that era, the era of trilobites. But what if they had gone off on their own way separate from everything else on planet Earth? What would they look like half a billion years later?<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Hmm, OK. Now we can talk about some of the science ideas in the book. Tell us about some of those.<br><strong><br>Warren: </strong>Well, since I've been studying evolution since I was a kid, I have been sort of a like an armchair biologist. I have always been endlessly fascinated by the process of evolution.<br><br>And three theories along the way occurred to me while I was studying various aspects of evolution. Two such theories are presented in Fragment and they are original theories.<br><br>One of them has gotten some interest from some actual geneticists who are studying lifespan. And that particular theory the theory of lifespan describes what dictates the lifespan of all species on Earth.<br><br>It was, basically, derived from looking at barnacles. And barnacles are something that fascinated Darwin to no end. They are amazing creatures which people don't seem to really understand.<br><br>They are crustaceans like crabs or lobsters. And they're obviously the weirdest crustacean on earth. And they only live for about two years. But mussels, that live right next to them, have almost an unlimited lifespan. They can live up to 70 years.<br><br>So, I was thinking, why in the world, would these two species have such a vastly different lifespan? And as I studied it, I realized that there was a difference between the way they procreate.Of course, mussels procreate by this huge bloom of sex cells that they all release all at the same time. Trillions of cells that drift in a cloud and end up creating the next generation.<br><br>Barnacles, however, have the largest sexual member in proportion to body size of any animal on earth. They must procreate by literally reaching it over to the next neighbor next to it in order to inseminate<br>that neighbor. That is how they create the next generation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So that was a clue and the fact that they reach sexual maturity in one year and die. The fact that they die by the time their offspring reach sexual maturity was a giant clue.<br><br>Of course, all species on Earth become unable to procreate if they mate with their offspring. And there are all kinds of different reasons and biological barriers that stop that from happening.<br><br>And if they didn't stop that from happening, then that species would die out in very short order. Even plants that procreate with their own offspring will become unable to procreate in only two or three<br>generations.<br><br>So, as I started to check this theory out by looking at animals and plants with lifespans, I found that the theory held true with absolutely every species across the board. Any animal that could theoretically, crossbreed with their own offspring had a fixed lifespan at twice the age of sexual maturity. So that they could not compete with the next generation and mate with their own offspring.<br><br>And this is true from everything from redwoods and sequoias, to whales and to any species, you can name. But certain species get around it without lifespan, because they don't need it.<br><br>For instance, the sequoia has made the same way that mussels do. Or the coral reefs do with giant clouds of sex sells that are all released at once. And the chances of them breeding with their own offspring are so slim that they're infinitesimal. They are vanishingly small.<br><br>If you look at something like some whales, they congregate in giant groups and they don't meet for life or anything. They just randomly mix in and they meet several times a year and that makes it impossible for them.</p>

<p>This is a republishing of the Metaphysics of Physics podcast interview with Warren Fahy, one of the authors of Creating Christ.  We discuss the archeology of Creating Christ as well as some other arguments for the thesis presented in the book.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those unaware, the Metaphysics of Physics was the previous incarnation of this site and for a time in included a podcast.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-introduction">Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today we have an interview with Warren Fahy, the co-author of Creating Christ. We have talked about Creating Christ before, when we interviewed the books of the other author, James Valliant. You can find that interview <a href="http://localhost/rational/interview-creating-christ-author/" data-type="post" data-id="645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. You can find out more about the <a href="https://www.creatingchrist.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.creatingchrist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today we are focusing on the archeology of Creating Christ, although we will cover a few other issues as well. We cover some stuff that is not covered so much or at all in our previous Creating Christ interview. Meaning that you should definitely listen to this one, even if you have listened to the other one. Or should that be, especially if you have listened to the other one?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-what-is-creating-christ">What is Creating Christ?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is Creating Christ? Some of you may not know. It is a book that shows the Roman origins of Christianity. Not simply the fact that the Roman Empire morphed into the Catholic Church, but the thesis that the Romans created the religion!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It might sound radical, but the book makes a very compelling case for how this must be true. If you have not read it, you really should. You can get it from Amazon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You really should listen to that interview first, as it gives a really in depth coverage of the book. Or, you can read the book first.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please note that the Amazon Kindle edition is currently not available. As far as I can tell, this may be due to some disgruntled customer complaining about the book's technical issues. Which I can assure, having owning a copy of it in Kindle, do not exist!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apparently, one customer complaint can cause items to go under review and be taken off the Kindle marketplace. If so, this policy should change!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have given them some polite feedback on this. You can too, if you want. But, please be civil. Incivility helps nobody, least of all Creating Christ or its fantastic authors!</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Do you and/or James have any of the coins from the book? Or more likely, replicas.<br><br><strong>Warren:</strong> It’s amazing how readily available those coins are. I don’t have one. But I got a Vespasian coin for James several years ago. And it was like 50 cents at a convention.<br><br>The Flavian minted millions and millions of coins and they're still quite available.<br><br>And so, I don't. Someday I would love to have a fish and anchor Titus coin. That is certainly something I will obtain at some point.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> In the book, we see that the cross was not the first primary symbol used by early Christians. Tell us about some of the earliest symbols they used.<br><br><strong>Warren:</strong> Well, if you go back to the very first catacombs, the very first evidence of archaeological evidence of Christianity, what you'll find is that the symbols they were using were not the Cross.<br><br>They were using the anchor, either flanked by fish or wrapped around by a fish. And so, these are the earliest symbols of Christianity that we know. And it wasn't until about two or three centuries later, when Constantine<br>instated Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, that he switched the symbol to the Cross.<br><br>He did so because he had seen a cross in the sky during a battle. And as he saw that vision, it turned the tide of the battle and he won the battle. And so, he decided to instate the cross is a symbol of Christianity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His mother traveled to the Holy Land. And as legend has it, brought back a piece of the original cross. And that was all part of the propaganda that instituted this new symbolism.<br><br>But before that, the fish and anchor that was the predominant symbol of<br>Christianity. And it was also the symbol used by the Flavian Emperors<br>Titus and very briefly his brother Domitian.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Tell us about the mosaic we see on the front cover of the newest editions of the book.<br><br><strong>Warren: </strong>Yes. Well, that, of course, was buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Herculaneum. Only two months after Emperor Titus seceded his father as emperor of Rome.<br><br>And it was an amazing find because it was almost like a legend for the symbolism used by the Christians.<br><br>Of course, there is no archaeological evidence from the first century of Christianity that has been recognized as evidence of Christianity.<br><br>So, this predated by decades, the first catacombs in which Titus’ own niece was buried. And that symbol that was on his coins, of the dolphin wrapped around an anchor, is echoed throughout those earliest Christians catacombs.<br><br>So, this symbol, this particular mosaic, was on the bottom of a pool in a gymnasium in Herculaneum. One that had originally been built by Emperor Augustus.<br><br>It was an imperial gymnasium that would have been under the care of the Flavians for decades. Because before then, Vespasian, the father of Titus had also a Flavian Emperor for 19 years.<br><br>There were always earthquakes going on in Herculaneum, because it was right next to the active volcano, Vesuvius. And so, they were constantly having to repair the bottom of pools. Because they would crack and then the water would leak out.And at the time of the eruption, there were two pools in this gymnasium.<br><br>One of which had been drained in order to effect repairs on the cracked bottom of the pool.<br><br>The other one that had this mosaic was filled, indicating that had been recently refurbished. So that would have been refurbished by the Flavians certainly.<br><br>And here they are using this symbol, which is reflected also on Titus’ coins. Where you see an anchor flanked by two dolphins. And two people swimming towards the anchor.<br><br>Exactly the sort of thing you would see in Christian catacombs for the next two or three centuries. And yet it predates Christian use of the symbol by decades.<br><br>That was astonishing. When I first found it, I called James. I think it was at 3:30 in the morning when I came across it. I was absolutely flabbergasted to see what that pool indicated.<br><br>At that point, probably nobody on earth knew exactly what an amazing find that mosaic was in terms of historical significance.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Which artefacts show us some of the religious syncretism going on with the figure of Christ?<br><br>I believe, for instance, that there is a depiction of Alexander the Great as Helios that seems to have inspired depictions of Jesus.<br><br><strong>Warren:</strong> Yes, there are. There are plenty. Of course, the mystery cults of the pagan world, the Hellenistic world, are combined with the Christian concept of the Messiah. In a way that's undeniable.<br><br>From Dionysius to Apollo, to the Sun God. All these pagan elements are combined within the idea of the Messiah. But the Jewish people would never have incorporated these into the idea of the Messiah. They had to have come from the pagan world.<br><br>And we can see those. Hercules dies and is resurrected and Dionysius is. Osiris dies and is resurrected. That is a very common thing.<br><br>And Mithra was born on December 25, in a manger visited by three wise men, three Magi, from the East that followed a star.<br><br>That all predated Christianity, but hundreds of years. And yet here it is in Christianity.So yes, there are lots and lots of different pagan influences in the syncretic conception of Jesus Christ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Why was the Sun God shown on a coin of Titus?<br><br><strong>Warren: </strong>Yeah, very good question.<br><br>Sol was a sun god and came from the East. And of course, the sun rises in the east. And he was associated with Apollo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apollo is a healer god. And Jesus is a healer god. He also rises from the East, in Judea. Just as Titus and Vespasian made their bones, so to speak, in their campaigns in Judea, to the east of Rome.<br><br>And so, they came from the East and rose to the throne of Rome, by their exploits in the East. So, the idea of a sun god, was convenient for Titus to use on his coins.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, the Flavians were seen as healers of Rome. Because they had just gone through a giant civil war. And the fire of Rome had devastated 70% of the city of Rome.<br><br>And then, of course, the Jewish war was a giant war of secession. A civil war between who is going to replace Nero after he died.<br><br>And so, this was a huge tumultuous time of history for Rome. And the Flavians saw themselves as healers who are going to now repair all the damage that had been done in the last couple of decades in Rome.<br><br>So that was a very convenient way for Titus to associate himself with Sol and with Apollo, these Eastern healer gods.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>We see the anchor symbol used by early Christians on Flavian tombs. Now, isn't that interesting?<br><br><strong>Warren:</strong> Oh, yes, I mean it well, it's absolutely astonishing. Because why would Christians be using symbols that were employed by the Flavius on their coins and on mosaics?<br><br>For instance, the one in Herculaneum. And on architectural details in, for instance, a temple of Venus that the Flavians built. And also, in the Coliseum, which the Flavians built. The Colosseum was originally called the Flavian Amphitheatre.<br><br>And so, all of these symbols are being employed by the Emperors of Rome. Even in the Coliseum where Christians were supposedly thrown to the lions.According to commonly accepted history, this is clearly a very inexplicable, parallel between the two groups. How could Christians be using Imperial symbols used in the Coliseum itself only a few miles away from their catacombs?<br><br>It implies that there was certainly some kind of a relationship between the Flavian dynasty, the Flavian emperors and Christianity. And there's ally no way around it.<br><br>There were so many different symbols that the Christians could have chosen. Certainly, ones that were not pagan, right?<br><br>Considering that it was supposed to have been a homegrown religion that came from Judea. One which would have already had great prescriptions from using pagan symbolism. Especially ones that that denoted a Roman pagan god like Apollo. Which is the symbol of dolphin, a symbol of Apollo.<br><br>The Jews would never have allowed that to be on their coins. In fact, they had elaborate money changing setup just so that people would ever donate coins with that kind of symbolism to the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>So yes, we have the fact that the Christians earliest symbols are the symbols that Emperor Titus used. The fact that they used the same symbols used throughout their archaeology, coins and mosaics, and so forth, is a profound problem for the traditional view of a huge conflict between the Roman emperors and the Christians</p>

<p>This is a republishing of the Metaphysics of Physics podcast interview with James Valliant, one of the authors of the book Creating Christ. We talk about this important book and what it reveals about the Roman origins of Christianity. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those unaware, the Metaphysics of Physics was the previous incarnation of this site and for a time in included a podcast.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-introduction">Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today we interview James Valliant, author of the important book "<a href="https://www.creatingchrist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Creating Christ: How Roman Emperors Invented Christianity</a>". This interview is basically a question-led interview and provides long answers to the relatively few questions which were required.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please note that some of our interviews reference "Metaphysics of Physics". This was the previous incarnation of the Rational Metaphysician.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-about-creating-christ">About Creating Christ</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The thesis of Creating Christ is that Christianity is the result of Roman propaganda in the first and second centuries. Designed to pacify Messianic Jews and to integrate them into Roman society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This might not seem to be an important subject or a probable claim, but it really is. If Christianity and its proper place in the history of the West is to be understood, it is important that the true nature of Christianity is understood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, is this claim true? Yes, as you will discover when you listen to the podcast and or read the transcript.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This episode is about one hour and fifty-six minutes long. As a result, we have not implemented the episode transcript in the usual form. We have provided a transcript in an edited and more formal form. It is much like a formal written answer to the question, however, the questions do very closely match the content of the audio.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, please note that there may be minor mistakes in the transcript. I have done my best to clean up any spelling and grammatical errors, however, due to time constraints, it has not been possible to edit out all possibility of such.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-brief-excerpt">Brief Excerpt</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna: James, please introduce yourself and explain the thesis of the book:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:</strong> My name is James Valliant. I am the co-author of the new book "Creating Christ: How Roman Emperors invented Christianity".<br><br>Basically, it takes on what would certainly strike most people today, certainly most Christians today, as a rather outrageous thesis. That in fact, the New Testament is Roman propaganda. That when it was originally written, it was written with a certain political agenda. As well as a certain theological agenda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most Christians would think that is crazy. They regard Christianity as the very opposite of Roman philosophy. They believe that the Romans persecuted Christianity. Hollywood has certainly convinced them that in the last century. But, there's a forgotten history here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two thousand years ago, there was cataclysmic war between the Roman Empire and Jewish Messianic rebels. And the rebellion was largely motivated by religious factors. It was that war, that cataclysmic war, that destroyed the temple, for example. Reduced it to the Wailing Wall that it is today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is difficult for me to imagine that Christianity emerging at that very same moment in history is just an accident. And when we started our research, we found nothing to contradict our theory. And then we found some remarkable physical evidence which basically demonstrated it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26421,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"is-style-rounded"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-rounded"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/coin_Roman-propaganda.jpg" alt="Roman coin." class="wp-image-26421"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Like many Roman coins were, Christianity is naked Roman propaganda.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In short, the thesis is that what we have in the New Testament is Roman propaganda written 2000 years ago to quell the Jewish revolt. That is very much the 30,000-foot level of analysis. Or I should say 10,000-meter level, from New Zealand. [footnote]Dwayne and Ashna were living in New Zealand when this was recorded[/footnote]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, from way up in the sky, looking down on it, the way to really look at it is that the moral idealism that we read in the New Testament is really a form of political propaganda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also regarded as moral idealism, both by Christians and even by secular people who have adopted it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And having forgotten the original context of the New Testament's creation, it's very easy to detach ourselves from that. And to think of the doctrine of Jesus Christ as sort of an unworldly, non-earthly form of moral idealism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But when you just change the angle slightly and you look at the entire New Testament from this new angle, suddenly everything is explained. We were simply blown away, I think when we started pulling that string because nothing contradicted it. And all the evidence seemed to confirm it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna: Does it matter how Christianity got started? Why does that matter to us now?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James:</strong> Well, that's a fair question. This is 2000-year-old history and Christianity has certainly changed considerably. At least it's operative doctrines have. The New Testament itself obviously has not changed, but the way Christians understand and live those doctrines has dramatically changed over the last 2000 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So that's a very good question. Why should we even care? Well, there are two very good answers to that. History matters. And particularly the history of ideas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Human beings are really motivated by their ideas and their history can be understood in terms of the power of ideas. Although these ideas are 2000 years old, they literally reach across the millennia and control our psychologies, our view of what's morally right and wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even people who are secular, people who tend to be on political left and who don't have much of a religion, have basically adopted Christian social ethics is their own. Socialists and Communists have basically applied the ethics and the social doctrine of the New Testament in a very consistentway. While simply leaving out all the mystical and miraculous stuff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, the values and the ideas expressed in the New Testament are still a living vital, powerful force. On the American left, they have adopted elements of pacifism, social altruism and concern for the poor above other considerations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The discovery, whether you're religious or not, that the moral idealism of Christianity is in fact simply a form of political propaganda, is crucially important.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:nextpage -->
<!--nextpage-->
<!-- /wp:nextpage -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm not saying that that every single thing in the New Testament is to be thrown out. I'm just saying that it needs to be re-evaluated. Every single moral doctrine in the New Testament needs to be re-evaluated in this light, rather than simply assumed as the moral ideal that it is held to be and<br>which is still controlling people today.<br><br>It seems to me that at one level it is important to understand that the New Testament isn't history. Scholars for the last 200 years have determined that the New Testament is not reliable history.<br><br>I think it's even far more powerful and far more important to identify what the New Testament actually is and to place it within its contemporary political and cultural context. Like we do any other literature or doctrine.<br><br>Once you do that, understanding what it is, is I think far more persuasive than simply saying it is not reliable.<br><br>In other words, if Jesus tells you to turn the other cheek, is that really the best policy, in light of the fact  that it was written in order to pacify rebels 2000 years ago?<br><br>We can see the agenda behind saying “Turn the other cheek” or “Blessed are the peacemakers”, etc. But before we simply adopt that as a more as our moral code, we need to understand the real motives behind the people that wrote those things.<br><br><strong>Ashna: Are there any modern parallels and can we apply what happened then to anything happening now?</strong><br><br><strong>James:</strong> Oh, very much so. In fact, the same basic conflict that we are discussing in the book, that cataclysmic war between the Roman Empire and Jewish Messianic zealots is still in a way, still playing out today.<br><br>The entire religion of Islam can I believe, be traced to the extreme monotheistic zealots of the first-century. The war between Rome and the Jewish rebels stratified Judaism of the first-century into three surviving religions.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rabbinic Judaism which survives today. And which greatly deemphasized the entire concept of Messiah. And which therefore reduced the political threat that Judaism might represent to foreign governments as Jews were living in diaspora as minorities and various Christian or Islamic cultures. Including Christianity, which is a sort of pro-Roman peaceful response to Jewish Messianic activities in the first-century.<br><br>And then of course, the Jewish rebels themselves, which never went away. They simply transformed over the centuries into Islam. The Islamic terrorism of today is in effect the same conflict of 2000 years ago. Western civilization in effect is still beating back a violent form of Eastern monotheism. In effect, we're fighting the same battle 2000 years later.<br><br>And the irony is that our response is very similar today. Western political leaders, for example, assure us that Islam means peace. That Islam commands peace and that Jihad is an internal conflict, not an actual rebellion. And in so doing, they're doing in effect precisely what the Romans did in creating Christianity.<br><br>The Romans said that Jewish Messianic religion is in effect a pacifistic religion. One that says, cooperate with political leaders, pay your taxes and turn the other cheek.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna: What about Roman persecution? Didn't they feed Christians to the lions? If not, why do you think this is widely believed?</strong><br><br><strong>James:</strong> The Roman Empire was a remarkably tolerant government when it came to foreign religions, comparatively speaking. They obviously did not have what we in the West today call freedom of religion or freedom of conscience.<br><br>There was religious persecution. Remember, politics and religion were joined at the hip in those days. There were political implications to any religious idea and there were religious implications to most political ideas.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Romans tried to be as tolerant as to as many foreign cults and religions as they possibly could. And so, persecution was not the norm within the Roman Empire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this Jewish War that I was referring to earlier was a major ideological challenge to the Romans. Jewish monotheism forbade them, for example, from participating in any kind of acknowledgement of Roman state deities. Which Romans thought just a perfunctory part of joining their empire and which other polytheistic cultures had no problem doing.</p>

Here is Vulcan, the Roman version of the Greek god Hephaestus.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of the Jews, with their strict form monotheism, found it difficult to participate in Roman society generally. Therefore, at first, the Romans tried to create exemptions for the Hebrews, exempting them from Emperor worship or public worship of Roman state deities.<br><br>Nonetheless, any connection with foreigners, any contact with foreigners, began to be regarded as pollution by the more extreme elements among the Hebrews.<br><br>And simultaneously, the Romans began to see the Jews in various antisemitic ways. And the conflict became inevitable.<br><br>There were continuous disturbances. Outbreaks of rebellion and riots in Alexandria, in Egypt and in Rome itself. Until finally in 66 open rebellion broke out in Judea itself, climaxing in the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. Decades later in the early second-century, still a second Jewish war would break out.<br><br>Now, those Jews who were leaders of this movement, religious and political leaders, rebel leaders, were obviously heavily persecuted by the Romans. Romans crucified them in the thousands. They tortured them for information.<br><br>The Romans were not boy scouts, they were ruthless conquerors. So, there was persecution and indeed the persecution of Messianic Jews in the first two centuries.<br><br>Christianity is an offshoot of Messianic Judaism and has adopted that persecution as their own, although what we call Christianity is an entirely different doctrine.<br><br>In fact, in many ways, the very opposite doctrine of the Jewish rebels. The rebels believed in the prophecies of the Old Testament that says the Messiah would come and liberate them in, at such times of foreign oppression.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hi everyone! This is episode nine of the Metaphysics of Physics podcast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am Ashna, and I your host and guide through the hallowed halls of the philosophy of science. Thanks for tuning in!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this show, we are fighting for a more rational world, mostly by looking through the lens of the philosophy of science. &nbsp;We raise awareness of issues within the philosophy of science and present alternative and rational approaches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can find all the episodes, transcripts and subscription options on the website at rationalmetaphysician.com.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today we have an interview with Juanma, physics and mathematics researcher, Objectivist and a fellow student of the philosophy of physics!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dwayne originally performed this interview. But, for various reasons we won’t&nbsp;go into here, his segments were rerecorded by myself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The audio may be of lower quality than normal. This is due to the fact that the interview was performed over Skype and the connection was of fairly low quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the most part, the audio should be of acceptable quality, but if parts are less clear there is a transcript which may help to clarify parts of the audio which might be difficult to make out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Note that the transcript includes the answers Juanma prepared in advance and does not include extra commentary improvised during the interview.&nbsp; This extra content is nice, but it is not crucial. You should be able to get the gist of the answers provided to the questions from the transcript.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, without further ado, let us start the interview.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="interview">Interview</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Juanma, please introduce yourself to our audience.</strong><br><strong><br></strong>I am Juanma, my name is Jaun Manuel.&nbsp; I am a Spanish physicist and I majored in theoretical physics.&nbsp; And then I spent a year doing research in the foundation of quantum mechanics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now I am living in London doing an MSc course in quite a different thing, which is the physics of complex systems.&nbsp; And I am also interested in philosophy and quantum mechanics interpretations.&nbsp; Which has been my motive even since I got into the science world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1) What did you study and why?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>In Madrid, I could have chosen mathematics or physics. In the end, I decided to major in physics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I decided this quite early during high school because the thing that most resonates with me is discovering and understanding natural phenomena.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mean, I love mathematics, but I felt it was too far from the real world.&nbsp; So, in the end, I wanted something a little bit more hands-on, even if I have always been more inclined to the more fundamental and theoretical side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2) What are the right reasons to pursue an academic career in physics or other sciences? What will enable you to make it?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Well, first of all, being quite the vocational career, so it takes a lot of dedication and interest. This is not a job that you can forget about once you get home, for example.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many scientists spend many more hours at work than they would normally have to, and some keep working even at home, even at night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My supervisor, last year, was hoping for the family to go to sleep so he could keep doing research, after past, I don’t know, midnight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26397,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"is-style-default"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat_naps.jpg" alt="A kitty and some math papers." class="wp-image-26397"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">If you want to go into the sciences, learn to catnap so you can better handle those long hours.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It takes so much dedication: it must be your passion, your job&nbsp;and your hobby.&nbsp; Which is quite of a thing to request for an interest in life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yeah, it just becomes your life.&nbsp; Everyone I have known who was taking a Ph.D. or just researching, have just turned science into their life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many jobs in this world, you can just forget about them once you are finished.&nbsp; But, science, particularly theoretical and fundamental sciences, you can to go bed and then come up with something, wake up (or stand up), take a note and then go back to bed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3) Alright, what are the things you did not like in academia?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>In the end, even if it seems to be quite a free enterprise, to decide what you are going to research, you actually depend on other people’s approval just to thrive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can’t just do some research without telling your university, for example. Your university must approve of your research interests; your peers must accept your papers for publication.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This sometimes turns into compliance with the status quo, you know. And so some arbitrary ideas grow over time simply because it’s not easy to get a voice if you disagree with the mainstream. Even if you present loads of compelling evidence, bring lots of information, sometimes the world of academia is quite reluctant to accept it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This, in turn, compromises the quality of the science you produce. That is an inherent thing in academia, it has been ever since universities were built and began being a thing in the scientific literature world.&nbsp; So, I don’t think there is much we can do about that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> What is&nbsp;it they say? Publish or perish? Well, they want you to publish stuff they think will bring in the funding. Which is fair, they obviously need the funding. But, less mainstream ideas might not be perceived as highly fundable ideas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4) What are the things you liked being in academia?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Well, you rarely meet people that aren’t passionate about their job, so everyone is pretty much up for discussion, time permitting, of course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can just go downstairs to the cafeteria and find some coffee and some interesting talk. For half an hour, one hour, about your research interests.&nbsp; So, you can share your passion with people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You don’t usually find this in some other jobs. People are usually willing to forget about their jobs once they are done.&nbsp; But, in science, since it is such a vocational thing, you are always finding someone, some peers. I love that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, when you don’t push reviewers’ tolerance too much, you enjoy a lot of creative freedom and it rarely becomes monotonous.&nbsp; Because you can always job back and forth between different research topics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna</strong>: Yeah, even the most irrational of them, say, Max Tegmark, are very passionate. I dont like what he has to say, but he is passionate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5) Do you wish you had studied something different and if so, why?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Thinking back, had I known how academic research would turn out, I would probably have gone for something I can still be creative at, but something that doesn’t demand some gentle form of compliance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is also this Atlas Shrugged-related dilemma. I don’t know if your audience is familiar with Atlas Shrugged plot, I won’t disclose that much.&nbsp; But, this dilemma is basically that that scientists get scorned and underestimated, usually poorly paid and discredited. While for example, pseudoscience gets more and more popular because people nowadays prefer being told what they want to believe rather than the blatant truth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26399,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"is-style-default"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/engineering.jpg" alt="An engineer at work." class="wp-image-26399"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Engineering is  a more practical, hands on job than the theoretical sciences. You also are more likely to be paid for your overtime.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So that plays against science and for say, religious or pseudoscientific views.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think it’s healthier for one’s emotional wellbeing to pursue a career where you get what you earn. I sometimes think that becoming a researcher somehow resembles becoming a nun…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s implicitly written in the terms of your job that you will dedicate as much as it takes of yourself to science and that what you get from becomes pretty much irrelevant. You have decided to put your whole life, all your time, all that it takes, into science.&nbsp; And you are pretty much signing up for a contract where all your time, all your spare time, isn’t that valuable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are about to publish some paper or if you are collaborating with someone, maybe you have to put in 18 hours. Well, that is a bit of an exaggeration, you have to put in a lot of hours into the day, perhaps sometimes skipping meals or coming home at past 10. It's just a scientist’s life. Nobody will see that, it is a strange thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you get some other job, you might get paid for extra hours. In science, it is implicitly accepted that you will have to do some extra hours at some point. But you just won’t get paid for that. Simply because you are expected to be so committed to science that you are not expected to expect something else in return.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would probably have gone for something which is more efficient in these terms. Where I can really get what I am working for and earn a decent amount to simply enjoy other aspects of life and not just let science absorb all of my time, all of my dedication.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was about to move to naval engineering, which is something where I can see the results of my work in my hands, where I can touch the results of my work. Which I don’t think is necessarily worse than doing science.&nbsp; But I also like to see where all of my work has got to. So, looking back, I might have chosen something of the sort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> Imagine how much better it would be if people lived in a world where we had greater respect for good science and more appreciation for how hard scientists work. I think they would be better off and might make more progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br><strong>6) What do you think about string theory?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Ah well, to paraphrase The Fountainhead, “I don’t think of string theory”. No, really, I think the methodology adopted by theoretical physicists in the last century inevitably leads to arbitrariness and, what’s even worse, a complete disregard for understanding natural phenomena.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:nextpage -->
<!--nextpage-->
<!-- /wp:nextpage -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, Descartes wrote several volumes rationalizing answers for every single scientific problem he could think of and then proceeded to proclaim that he had discovered everything. Literally, he said that. But at the very least he intended to understand the world around him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26400,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"is-style-default"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Descartes.jpg" alt="Portrait of Rene Descartes" class="wp-image-26400"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Descartes is, fairly, said to the be the father of modern philosophy. This is not a good thing.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Modern physicists make the exact same guesses, only mathematically more sophisticated, but they don’t care about explaining reality. All that matters to them is to create a model, they say, that predicts numbers, and the less conceptual they get, the better; this is known as the “shut up and compute” principle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is, of course, a losing strategy for science, but they get their peers’ appraisal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ironically, however, mathematicians know that you can always make a model sophisticated enough to account for any data, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good model if you can’t make any sense out of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, I could write down a set of equations explaining in detail when and how the light inside my fridge will turn on and off as I open and close the door, but have I actually learned anything about why it behaves so?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could claim that a ghost is operating the light, and my equations would not be able to contradict that because all they do is predict results rather than explain the facts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>String theory does exactly the same thing and that’s why I consider that neither of those are even scientific in nature. They’re more like mystical claims, epistemologically speaking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:&nbsp;</strong>I think the ghost theory might make more sense than string theory. Or, at least be easier to understand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7) Who is your favorite figure in physics?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Probably saying ‘Newton’ would be too uninteresting as we all know of his genius, and some of the audience will even be familiar with his work in the epistemological field of induction. So, to be a bit more of a romantic spirit, I will say ‘Ludwig Boltzmann’.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He vigorously fought for the relevance of philosophy in scientific activity, against the rising positivist current of his time, led by Ernst Mach. So, he was quite a hero in my view.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He laid the foundation for, and then developed, statistical mechanics, which is the link between microscopic and macroscopic behaviour of physical systems. It is such an important core theory, because, for example, the existence of atoms could be proven in this way. So, this was actually the greatest feat in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; So considered by all, nearly all, historians of science, because it was a causal explanation</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then, in his time, causal explanations&nbsp;were severely disregarded, so the arrival of atomic theory as a proper, integrated explanation of microscopic was delayed because of the opposition to Boltzmann’s views. But he defended it to the bone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, regardless of the outcome, he stood against a great philosophical danger</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> Boltzmann, he made my favorite list too, for basically the same reasons!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>8) Least favorite figures?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Now it’d be a perfect moment to say ‘Ernst Mach’, but he wasn’t even a scientist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, Descartes was so thoroughly wrong it’s funny to read him. It is so funny, I don’t really hold any real antipathy against him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I’d say modern physicists get the worst of me. And particularly Stephen Hawkins’ figure has been remarkably damaging Fto the philosophy of science.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He even claimed that philosophy was dead and science had to take over. He could get eloquently scornful with opposing views, to the delight of his followers, many of which, not versed in science, would absorb and spread this Neo-positivist viewpoint beyond the realm of science.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I think he was particularly damaging.&nbsp; And I think he was also quite overrated. If you look through his scientific feats, I think that the most important one was Hawking Radiation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yeah, I think he would be my least favorite figure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> Yeah, Feynman agreed on that, and so do a lot of physicists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Juanma:</strong> Yeah, it is a pity, right? Because Feynman was such a great guy. Maybe he had just absorbed too much of the philosophies of his time, he wasn't that much to blame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> Ernst Mach did not make my list, but only because he was not, as you point out, a scientist.&nbsp; But, he certainly deserves to make one of the lists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>9) Which figures in physics and or math have been the most influential?<br></strong>The most influential have been those who have made a philosophical difference. There have been great mathematicians who have pushed their fields forward enormously: Gauss, Riemann, Euler…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But their mathematical feats aren’t very influential: they are technical, foundational, deep and extremely useful, but I think being influential here is changing the way the whole subject is approached, for good or bad. In this, Newton and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cau</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chy</a>, to mention some, have been really influential, have really made a difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26401,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"is-style-default"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cauchy.jpg" alt="Portrait of Augustin Louis Cauchy." class="wp-image-26401"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Portrait of Augustin Louis Cauchy.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cauchy, for example, found a way of dealing with limits without ever appealing to the invalid concept of ‘infinity’. By that time engineers would rationalize the theory of limit taking by canceling infinities out and things like that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cauchy found the way around this and thus laid the foundation not only for mathematical analysis, but also for the modern standard of mathematical rigor. S,o he really made a difference in the whole field of mathematics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for physics, and aside from Newton… Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr have been influential characters. Although promoters of unreason in science, each in his own&nbsp;way, the truth is that they paved the way for a change in the way scientists work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:nextpage -->
<!--nextpage-->
<!-- /wp:nextpage -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>10) You have studied a lot of physics and done some research.&nbsp; Did you enjoy it? What did you like about it? What did you not like about it?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have much enjoyed the thrill of advancing humanity’s knowledge, it seems quite a romantic attempt. I actually had a professor who would say that you can’t get any nobler than that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it also gives you quite a lot of creative freedom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What I did not like was that I found that my epistemological standards were mostly incompatible with how I was asked to validate my work. And this is not something related to simply being approved by people around you.&nbsp; But, you might not be allowed to do some of your work if you do not comply with their standards.&nbsp; Sometimes my standards were quite different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>11) Do you get the impression that when it comes to certain parts of physics, there are a lot of floating abstractions which nobody understands?</strong><br><br>Absolutely, it even propagates back. Modern praxis is contaminating the teaching of classical concepts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Einstein said that you do not fully understand a physical concept unless you can describe it in such a way that your grandma can understand it. I think that was a very good way of looking at it.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, unfortunately, there’s very little of this today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Bohr who won that debate, so now the general trend is for lecturers to focus on the mathematical development of the theory, with extreme cases where you get scorned at for asking ‘why’.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that is talking out of experience. I have seen a lecturer laughing at a classmate because she asked “But why is that the case? Why does that happen?”.&nbsp; And he pointed at the blackboard and said: “That is the mathematical proof, that is the 'why'. There is no 'why' beyond that”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, there a quite a lot of floating abstractions.&nbsp; For example, when classical studied thermodynamics, which is a well-established theory, which was established between the 17<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, I was presented it in an axiomatic way. Pretty much in the same way very abstract mathematics is presented and constructed today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, we tried to deduce as much as we could from one axiom. And then once we couldn’t deduce any other things or once we came up with questions we couldn’t find an answer for in our set of axioms, we would add yet another one.&nbsp; And those axioms would eventually become the Laws of Thermodynamics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a really rationalistic way of presenting the theory and it is exactly the opposite way to which it was induced and discovered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, the very same theory which was established in one way across many centuries can be flipped up and looked up from the opposite perceptive. And then what used to be so well established, sadly becomes a total floating abstraction and people really don’t get a hold of the theory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So yeah, it even back propagates as I say.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> I dont think too many grandmas would understand much of anything proposed today even if they had a postdoc...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Juanma:</strong> That is quite true. We could try it. I have actually tried with my grandma and I would like to think some of the things she got her head around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:&nbsp;</strong>If any grandma can understand string theory, she is the smartest in history...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Juanma:</strong> Well, you are quite right about that. Well, some of them do knitting, so you could use that analogy.&nbsp; Even if string theorists would tell you to go to the physicist hell because you are talking about a real thing like a thread.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>12) Which philosophers do you think have the greatest influence on modern physics?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Theoretical physicists usually think that philosophy has no influence on their research and their methodology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, the fact is that Positivism in the late 1800s, devised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ernst </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mach</a>, is at the foundation of the hypothetic-deductive method. Which is nowadays taught as a synonym for the scientific method.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26404,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"is-style-default"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ErnstMach.jpg" alt="Photo of Ernst Mach." class="wp-image-26404"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">I think we will be hearing a lot more from Ernst Mach in future posts...</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hypothetic-deductive method says you should first propose whatever comes to your mind and then see if evidence can back it up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The inductive method says quite the opposite thing. You decide to look into some aspect of reality and then you make experiments and then you try to integrate that with the full context of your knowledge. So, it is kind of doing things backward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, this [hypothetic-deductive] method has been used and as I say, it has been taught as<em> the</em> scientific method. They don’t even make any mention of induction or any other way of understanding the real world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if that has been the chief scientific method and that has been what has brought all of the important results in the history of science. But, nowadays it is completely forgotten.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So yeah, the hypothetic-deductive has been the most influential, ideological aspect of modern physics today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is what detaches the model from conceptual understanding. &nbsp;I think that is the most dangerous problem with this method.&nbsp; In my view, that is what lays the core of all this trend to forget about the physical meaning of the implication or causal relationships in the real world and to focus only on modeling and mathematical analysis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> Yeah, you can prove almost anything if you start with your conclusion and work backward from that. Isn't that what religious people try to do all the time?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Juanma:</strong> Yeah, maybe they have learned it from religious&nbsp;theorists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>13) If you could do one thing to improve the state of modern physics, what would it be?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>I would teach philosophy and I would teach the importance of philosophy. That’s all there is at the heart of this whole mess. And, more specifically, I would explain why induction is a valid methodology while hypothetic-deductive approaches are flawed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think if you can get that in the minds of modern want-to-be scientists, then the whole of the world of academia and the world of scientific research will improve significantly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will basically get much better scientists when they know why they are doing it and why it is valid that they reason in one specific way and not some other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> A lesson badly needed, given how dismissive many in the field are of philosophy. I dont think there are a lot of great inductive thinkers in the field or in any field for that matter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;Juanma: </strong>Other than teaching philosophy and letting it spread and gain influence all the time, I can really see nothing that can be done to improve scientific research.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most researchers are far too stubborn to change their minds now and it is a saying among physicists that if you want a clever idea to spread out and become popular, you should first wait for the current generation of physicists to just retire or die before the new idea can really shine out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that is actually a really sad thing, but it is systematic of a really widespread problem in academia that some new ideas get rejected too quickly. When actually, science should be ready to accept reasonable proposals and new viewpoints.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> Yeap, they better start training the next generation of physicists in philosophy. They should put it in high school, certainly first-year college classes. Since it is at least as important as physics classes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:nextpage -->
<!--nextpage-->
<!-- /wp:nextpage -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>14) Do you think modern physics can be saved? If so, how?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Oh, I do think it can be saved. After all, the mathematics is well crafted. All it takes is scientists who devote more time to understanding what can already be described instead of elaborating further in the mathematical sense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This may seem a utopia, but actually, mathematicians do that. They recognize the value in understanding stuff as much as moving forward. It is a cultural, or rather sub-cultural, thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Physicists tend to be much less interested in this and this is reflected in the “demand” for such advancing work. For deducing new things from what has already been deduced rather than actually giving a better intuition or understanding of what has already been discovered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna</strong>: That sounds quite achievable, given the right cultural changes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>15) Do you get the impression that physicists understand what mathematics is why it is so useful?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>No, they don’t. No, I don’t think they do. But fortunately, mathematics is too solid to be affected by their users’ misconceptions, most of the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many physicists like to say that mathematics is the language of the universe as if natural phenomena were somehow written in a code. Quite close to a divine creator viewpoint, it seems to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I find it quite simple: we create mathematical concepts, and then theorems and theories based on those concepts are discovered as necessary implications of the definitions that we created.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I may be taking a long shot here, but I think they don’t realize that we create mathematical concepts because they have given up on induction, so they only focus on the deductive part. Which is a sad thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> I think the Republic represents a fairly accurate view of what many consider mathematics to be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26405,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"is-style-default"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PlatoAndAristotle.jpg" alt="Plato and Aristotle walking." class="wp-image-26405"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Time for the usual picture of Plato. This time we have Aristotle, to his right.  Which do you think is a better role model for rational physics?</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>16) What do you think about all these quests for a “Theory of Everything?”</strong><br><strong><br></strong>I find it funny… What exactly are they looking for? Isn’t a compendium of all human knowledge by definition an attempt at a theory of everything? I don’t quite get the definition they give.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do they want to unify forces and particles? How is that supposed to be a theory of everything? Good luck using that theory to explain phase transitions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then why do they call it “of everything”? I think it is of everything they deem worthy of such a godlike theory?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being more realistic and also more ambitious, wouldn’t something like conservation of energy be a much, much better candidate for a theory of literally everything?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I think that they are lost in their quest for grandeur. You know what I mean? I don’t think it is, ultimately, about understanding the world or getting a unified description of it. It is mostly about feeling as though they have ascended into a godly realm or something like that. That they have crowned human knowledge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think they are looking for something of a personal glory. Which I think is OK, but it is not in finding such an apparent “Theory of Everything”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Human knowledge, by definition, is the theory of everything. As we get going, it just advances forward and forward. And since everything is integrated, that is a “Theory of Everything”. Anything else is just pretense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> I think they basically want to be able to describe everything in physics in a set of equations you can print on a t-shirt.&nbsp; I have heard some of them say this<strong>.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;Juanma: </strong>If you want a short equation to describe everything in physics, you could just write, "E dot equals zero".&nbsp; I mean, that is something that you can print on a t-shirt. That's not something most people will really understand.&nbsp; So, it is not so easily solved.&nbsp; But, being honest, I think that is the closest you will ever get to a "Theory of Everything", just saying that energy gets conserved over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think emergent properties prove that no such monastic Theory of Everything will ever be achievable. Because at different levels, the very same physical objects behave or give way to very different results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, you can't just encode macroscopic behaviors and microscopic behaviors in a table of fundamental particles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any attempt at what they call a "Theory of Everything" is not really a "Theory of Everything".&nbsp; It is just a theory of everything they care about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>17) There are, of course, other interpretations of quantum physics than the Copenhagen one. To what extent are they taken seriously?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, generally speaking, fundamental physicists can be divided into two big groups, aside from sparse exceptions.&nbsp;On the one hand we have neo-Positivists, who disregard anything that contains the words “explanation”, “interpretation”, “physical meaning” or anything of the sort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, there are mystics who enjoy pretending that science-fiction is actually real. These, interestingly, only take seriously whatever is deranged, and disregard any serious attempt at explaining things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They get really picky when you try to say electrons have a physically determinate position, but they are totally okay with it, somehow crossing two slits at the same time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s just going by emotion: instead of considering facts, they stick to whatever picture seems more appealing to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna</strong>: I imagine of Bohr was alive, he would tell us to try blend all these approaches together somehow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>18) Tell us about some of the most troublesome trends you have encountered in your studies and/or research?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have really struggled with the ‘shut up and compute’ paradigm, because I simply cannot work like that: if I don’t fully understand what I’m doing, I get blocked, because my mind is unable to focus on anything other than understanding it. I can’t go on if I don’t get a sense, at least a sense, of what I’m doing, and when nobody provides such conceptual explanations, I’m in serious trouble.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26406,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"is-style-default"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/headache.jpg" alt="Man with headache clutching head." class="wp-image-26406"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Here is what the Shut Up and Compute paradigm does for me ...</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a more technical level, there’s one huge mistake that pops up everywhere in physics education. Many absorb it inadvertently, but it’s quite harmful. Some people implicitly think in terms of Aristotle’s “final causes”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is, reality acts in some way <em>so that</em> something else happens or remains true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, many people will state that “the system evolves in order to reach the state of minimum energy”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They will also say that “electric charges move around a conductor so that the field inside is zero”. Or that “some random events will happen to compensate some others in probability”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other words, to them, the laws of the universe, perhaps “written in mathematical language” in some mystical way, are literally obeyed by reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes they’re quite literal about this, stating that “the equation must hold, so this must happen”. This is a blatant reversal of the cause and the effect principle, or premises and implications for that matter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think that is a total misunderstanding of causality, and people who get used to thinking that way usually lose their ability to think causally. And many people do that, let me tell you, many people do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> My brain works that way.&nbsp; If I am reading something and I cannot understand it my brain freezes and says "you are not going on until you figure out what that was all about".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, sometimes I know it there is not much to understand, because is not explained, so I just have to move on.<br><br><strong>19)Tell us about some of your better experiences in your studies and or research. Is there anything that gives you hope?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Well, not to brag about it, but most of my best experiences during my studies starred me. I would be a rebel, which felt liberating but it also brought up some trouble.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:nextpage -->
<!--nextpage-->
<!-- /wp:nextpage -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember once that I was in a lab, measuring the viscosity of a liquid by taking measurements on the speed of metal balls falling through a tube filled with the liquid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The equation to describe this assumed the ball was falling in a big pool of liquid, away from the walls of the container, and this wasn’t the case, of course, since it was a rather fine tube.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To account for that, a correction had to be made. It was a multiplicative factor, and my lab tutors were insisting that we made a correction to the experimental data so that they matched the model’s prediction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mathematically, that is equivalent to multiplying the model’s prediction by the inverse of that factor, so why on Earth would you “correct the facts” to fit the model instead of correcting the model to fit the facts?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, they insisted thoroughly. At least they could have told me it was all the same and they didn’t care, but they didn’t. They insisted that I corrected the data. And I did not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I corrected the model.  And I think they gave me a lower grade for that, and I happily accepted it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think it’s not very hopeful if there’s only one person appearing in good experiences, so here’s another one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I enrolled in History of Physics, which sounds like a sensible and interesting thing to do, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, the lecturer hadn’t realized that knowing history does not guarantee that you know philosophy, so she messed up saying that Newton brought Rationalism into physic. Which is, wow, a horrible thing to say. I think she meant to say that he intended to use reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, she once asked a loaded question, assuming that determinism in physics (the idea that nature acts in specific ways and never causelessly) somehow implied that there was no free will.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was looking through the window, listening to my classmates jabbering one after the other. It was a damn horrible show. And then, among those incongruent rationalizations and pointless mumbo-jumbo, a girl challenged the lecturer’s premise implicit in the question. I quickly turned my head to find that heroine of the moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was pretty much the end of it, nothing followed from there, but it was good to see someone able to question the premises thrown at her instead of playing logical chess with unchecked premises.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this is yet another story: I took part in a debate where a group of students antagonizing modern quantum mechanics tried to spread out some interesting results that have been coming up in recent years. Most of the audience still favored quantum woo, but some people were impressed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple years ago a classical system was set up in a completely analogous way as that of a quantum particle in a confined region, and the results matched perfectly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I think people are slowly discovering that there is so much more classical physics to quantum physics than modern physicists would like to accept.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26409,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"size-full wp-image-888 is-style-default"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-image-888 is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Aristotle_Bust.jpg" alt="Marble bust of Aristotle." class="wp-image-26409"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Not many man can lay claim to making the modern world possible.  However, Aristotle can.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, if you want to pick up an inspiring story, this last one is the one that most inspires me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna</strong>: Actually, that is a good point. I have noticed an upsurge in interest in applying classical ideas to quantum physics and an increased interest in alternatives to the Copenhagen Interpretation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t know if it is a just relatively few in the field or if it may be a more significant thing than I realize. Nor am I too sure what is causing it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I haven’t been following it very closely at the moment, so I don't know if it is a trend still going strong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;Juanma:&nbsp;</strong>Actually, I have gotten impressed in my MSc, because it quite a different topic than quantum physics.&nbsp; But, apparently, there is more to it than we thought in the beginning because of Markov Chains and the probability evolution of systems which are deterministic but not fully understood or not easily trackable because maybe they have many components. And are so deemed as random processes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a lot of theory around these systems which resembles or matches Schrodinger's Equation and wave functions.&nbsp; So, there is a lot to be understood of the probabilities in quantum physics by means of these probabilities which can describe any sort of event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, the probability of extinction for a particular species in an ecosystem.&nbsp; Which is not only a classical concept but even a non-physical one, because it is about animals eating each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So yeah, apparently, this theory has brought up a lot of interesting ideas that may extend the realm in which Schrodinger's Equation was originally conceived.&nbsp; I'm not sure, but maybe this has advanced attempts to find classical correspondence to quantum concepts. And they have been quite successful thus far.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> I guess it helps that a lot of physicists are cruising on philosophical inertia. They dont really care that much about the philosophies that they are applying. There is no real passion or interest in the philosophy. So, to some extent, they can absorb a few better ideas here and there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They don't understand the philosophies they are applying<strong>.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Juanma: </strong>And they will even think the philosophies are irrelevant, while they are actually using it implicitly.&nbsp; So, that makes them even more clueless. They don't even know that there is a problem to be solved in their philosophical viewpoints.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>20) Which do you think is more or less rational, as practiced today? Math or physics?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Huh, this is an easy question. Mathematics is way, way more rational. Mathematicians keep a healthy sense of curiosity and they care about ideas and conceptual understanding beyond symbols. Physicists, as you just said, are much more careless about that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, a paradigmatic example of this is the infamous statement that the sum of all positive integers somehow gives minus one over twelve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s mostly physicists that enjoy dazzling their audience with this (and that should ring a bell if you remember how they favor nonsensical interpretations in quantum mechanics just because they look mysterious).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26410,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"wp-image-891 size-full is-style-default"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-image-891 is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/olderNewton.jpg" alt="Older Isaac Newton." class="wp-image-26410"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Here is an older Newton.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, a proper mathematician, and I say proper, will hack this confusion into pieces by stating the simple truth, which is the job of a proper mathematician, by the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What happens in this particular case, is that the function which gives that value cannot be associated with an infinite sum in that case because that infinite sum representation of the function is valid for arguments strictly greater than positive one, actually, real numbers, and the argument giving minus one over twelve is negative one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, this infinite series representation does not apply to that argument. But, physicists prefer not to say anything about that, they conveniently omit it because it somehow spoils the fun, I think. So then they can keep the magic alive that somehow such an apparent contradiction could hold in the real world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> If I remember correctly, that silly equation you mentioned originally came up in the context of string theory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Juanma:</strong> Yeah, it is true. They get these infinite matrices. And there are the positive integers on the diagonal. So, they want to characterize the matrix by its trace, which is the sum of the elements in the diagonal. So, of course, they get the sum of all the positive integers.</p>

<p id="d19e">In this article, I am going to show that religious faith is unreasonable, and that no honest person should ever exercise faith. We can make very similar arguments about other kinds of faith. However, we will focus on religious faith.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-faith"><strong>What is Faith?</strong></h2>

<p id="63a2">I define faith as:</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>Dwayne Davies</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="17ba">The only claims of any merit are those that help us achieve some good value or another. That value might be to understand how to deal with the world around you and stay alive. It might be how to get lots of money and buy that house you want. It could be any value that you might imagine. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="17ba">However, for a value and claim to be of worth, it must help us achieve some purpose based on reality. If not, of what use could it possibly be to anyone?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To achieve good values, we must deal with the world as it really is. We must understand how the world works and deal with reality as it is. Only the things that help us do this help us to achieve values. Therefore, in order to help us achieve values in the real world, a claim must have a valid relation to the world. It must have some relation to observable facts. If not, then it is impossible for it to have any merit. That which has no relation to the real world is useless in achieving values. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we are going to make or evaluate claims about reality, the only ones that are of any use in achieving values are those that correspond with reality. Truth is correspondence with reality. Truth is that which corresponds to the way things are. Therefore, the only claim that has any merit is that which has some truth to it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/firmament500.jpg" alt="Earth under a dome (the firmament)." class="wp-image-26326"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Bible seems to think the Earth is flat and with a over it. Possibly with stars embedded into the dome. But we should not take its word for any of that, should we?</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But how do we know whether a claim is true? You must first establish the possibility of the claim. If we make a claim, we should establish that there is some evidence or proof behind it. If you make an assertion without evidence, we cannot show it to correspond to reality. That assertion is, therefore, entirely without merit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do we establish whether something is possible? We discuss that in <a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/the-possible-and-the-impossible/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://dwaynedavies.com/the-possible-and-the-impossible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article on possibility.</a> Indeed, we took much of this section from that article.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To summarize that article, before we take any claim seriously, we must first establish that there is some evidence that it might be true. Otherwise, it is a waste of time considering it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="2b1f">If we make a claim, we should establish that there is some evidence or proof behind it. Why should anyone accept any claim in the absence of evidence? Why would anyone do this when it could have no objective value? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because they want it to be true. They have no cognitive reason to want it to be true. That person simply feels that it is preferable for it to be true. They feel an emotional response to the assertions being made, which makes them want to believe that the assertion must be true. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no reason to accept something merely because you want it to be true. Emotions are not tools of cognition. A claim is not valid because you wish it to be so. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that is what faith is, the acceptance of things for which there is no evidence or proof. Faith is, therefore, the acceptance of baseless assertions for no reason and because someone wants it to be true based on emotion. However, emotions are not a valid reason for believing something.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-harm">What is the Harm?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="fba5">Faith and reality are always in conflict. So is virtually every claim accepted for no reason and defended against reason. Knowing the truth is not a trivial task. It requires careful observation of reality, serious thought and a dedication to understanding the facts for what they are. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="a0eb">Faith is the refusal to do any of that. Faith is the attempt to bypass thought and proceed directly to the truth by wishing empty assertions to be fact. As though wanting something to be true somehow makes it so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="622c">Assertions accepted on faith are almost always wrong. There is no real chance that anything you believe for no reason corresponds to the facts. There is essentially no chance that your blind assertions are true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26328,"width":640,"height":426,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Franz-Von-Stuck-adam-and-EveSmaller.jpg" alt="Eve presents Adam the apple in the snake's mouth." class="wp-image-26328" width="640" height="426"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The story of Adam and Eve condemns man for having the knowledge of good and evil. Condemns man for seeking an understanding of the world...</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Which is why the Bible is almost invariably wrong about everything. It is wrong about the shape of the Earth, and when it asserts that pi is exactly three. It is wrong when it pretends that Earth has a glass dome above it that lets the rain in. There are lots of other silly examples like this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, almost everything every religion says about the universe is wrong. That is why their cosmologies are always wrong. That is why, when religions say what is right or wrong, they are frequently wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many religions prohibit things like theft or murder, in certain circumstances. The Bible includes commandments not to steal or murder. Most of us would agree that these are objectively wrong. These are examples of the few instances of things in the Bible that reasonable people might agree with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Bible does not forbid murder because of any valid reasoning. It does not forbid killing people because of any real respect for individual rights. It does this because it asserts God would not like this for reasons that are not entirely clear.  It is the same with stealing, which is not forbidden because of any arguments to do with property rights, but again for reasons that God does not make clear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So even when it forbids things that reasonable people might consider wrong, it does not do so for valid reasons. Religions forbid things for invalid reasons and manage to once again prove that they are wrong. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="f195">Once you have rejected reality and embraced faith, what does that leave you to believe? Whatever you want to believe in, as long as we assume it blindly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="63fe">Most often, this takes the form of whatever is emotionally satisfying or seems superficially easy to grasp. Or which provides moral guidance with little to no actual connection to how man should act to be happy and thrive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="0e6a">But just because something is easy to understand does not mean that it is true. Something like the theory of a flat Earth might seem intuitive. However, the Earth is not flat. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seemed intuitive to the Greeks that there were no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">irr</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ational numbers</a>. However, they were wrong and irrational numbers turn up all the time in mathematics. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:nextpage -->
<!--nextpage-->
<!-- /wp:nextpage -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="b1fa">It might seem obvious that nothing could exist without a Creator. But it does not matter how intuitive this might seem, it is incorrect. It does not matter if you think that a claim seems intuitive, simple or obvious. That does not make it correct. Many of the most important numbers used in mathematics, such as pi [footnote]the ratio between the circumference of a circle to its diameter.[/footnote] are irrational numbers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="4531">Claims that seem intuitive are frequently wrong. Reality rarely conforms to our simple intuitions. What many people think is obvious and logical is proof that they are ignorant and do not know how to think.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="128d">The religions of every almost culture believe in a spiritual existence after death where the spirit endures after the body dies. Why? Not because there is any reason to believe this. No, but because this is emotionally satisfying. Many people cannot deal with the fact that their consciousness will cease existing after their body dies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many people cannot imagine what happens after they die. They cannot imagine how their consciousness could just go away. So it is comforting to imagine it does not happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1024px-The_Reign_of_Heavens_MET_DP823640.jpg" alt="Heaven" class="wp-image-26329"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Yes, Heaven may be an emotionally satisfying idea, but it just encourages people to waste their life.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are also those that cannot grasp that there can be any objective morality in the natural world. These people believe that the only way that any morality could exist is if some intelligent being imposed his will upon the world. They do not grasp that morality is not a matter of what some cosmic being imposes upon the world. They cannot grasp the concept of objective morality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite what they believe, objective morality exists. There are principles of right and wrong that are true regardless of what any mind asserts. What is right or wrong depends on the nature of reality and what is good or bad according to a standard. That standard is life. What is right or wrong are objective facts and can be determined by using life as a standard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The religious rarely recognize the existence of objective morality. If there is no objective morality, then where could morality come from? The only alternative is for morality to be a matter of arbitrary say-so. The only alternative is for someone to tell them what is right or wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many people look for powerful, allegedly wise supernatural beings to tell them what is moral. Gods fit that need nicely. They need a system of morality to guide their actions. Since they think there is no objective morality, then gods must provide that moral code for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If God is going to provide a moral code, it is only logical that God gets to enforce his moral code. How is he to do this?  There must be some way of enforcing God's moral judgement, surely?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is a major function of the afterlife in many religions. Once you die, the gods will judge you according to the morality of the religion and reward or punish you accordingly. If you are a devout follower of the religion, the gods will reward you in the world after this one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a kind of coercive control. It says to people that they have to toe the line of the religion and believe what they say. God will punish them if they disobey, not only in this life but after this life. However, if they listen to the religious teachings, they will receive spiritual rewards beyond anything in this life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This creates a powerful emotional incentive to believe whatever the religion tells them. To ignore any niggling doubts that they might have. To not listen to anyone that might try to argue with them and to just believe. They only get all of that nice afterlife stuff if obey the moral teachings of the religion and do the bidding of the clergy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="e2c5">Every religion tries to offer its followers moral teachings. We all need moral guidance to help choose which actions to take in life. Once you have rejected reality, you must get that moral guidance from somewhere. Religions are more than happy to offer that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="0209">This guidance typically comes with plenty of threats and other forms of emotional manipulation. It usually includes threats of fate worse than death intended to scare the worshipers into obedience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="d5dd">When you have no argument for why someone should do what you say, then you will need to appeal to emotions. You will need to make arbitrary claims intended to scare them into obedience. Arbitrary claims that promise happiness for obedience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="1f6b">If you have no real arguments, then appeal to emotions is all you have to get your followers to obey your moral teachings. It is, therefore, hardly surprising that the most devoutly religious people are also the most heavily emotionally invested in their religion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="9d66">They are told that if they have faith then the gods will reward them with impossible miracles. However, if they disobey, they will suffer terrifying torments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26330,"width":600,"height":450,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","className":"is-style-default"} -->

Apparently he needs us to believe in him. As if otherwise he might stop existing... </figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="c1d7">The devoutly religious are heavily invested in this nonsense. They believe that religion is the only means of moral guidance they have. They refuse to consider that there can be any other alternatives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="5ec2">It should come as little surprise that many of these people desperately cling to the teachings of their religion. Then it should also come as little surprise that since reality conflicts with religion, the devout will defend their religion against reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="fb02">Their faith will invariably clash with science and reality. Faith says one thing, but science will always say another. Therefore, if they perceive science as a threat to their faith, it is the practice of science that they must discard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="2e5c">When reality invariably clashes with their religion, they have two fundamental choices: to reject their faith as dishonest or to reject reality. In embracing faith, they have already rejected reality, so they almost invariably continue to reject reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="2a7a">Many religious people know what the facts are but will not abandon their faith. Reality gets rejected for clashing with their delusions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="0bd5">The devoutly religious cannot allow reality to destroy their faith. If faith and reality itself clash, then it is the offending reality that must lose out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="4751">Faith requires that it is defended against the intrusion of reason. It is the acceptance of assertions with no attempt to discover facts. It is an attempt to defend oneself against inconvenient truths.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:nextpage -->
<!--nextpage-->
<!-- /wp:nextpage -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="16d7">The most dishonest position possible is knowing what the facts are and choosing to pretend that they are not so. This is exactly what the devout must do to continue believing. Thus, the devout are some of the most dishonest people that you are likely to meet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="18df">The truth rarely matters to the devoutly religious. If it mattered to them, they would not be devoutly religious. The devout would not have faith in anything at all!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="0327">If they embraced reality at the expense of their faith, they would get none of the rewards and all those terrible punishments. Of course, it never occurs to them that fighting reality is impossible. It never occurs to them that those that fight reality must always face the consequences of their dishonesty.</p>

<p id="cb78">As with any form of dishonesty, there are consequences for holding faith in anything. Only honest men can deal with reality as it is. Dishonest men hide from reality and pretend things are not what they are. To the extent they need this knowledge to deal with reality, the dishonest person cannot do so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="01d7">That is the harm in religion. It is the refusal to know reality and to accept whatever one wishes to believe. Assertions accepted on faith are almost always wrong about anything of consequence.</p>

<p id="e950">Faith is the epistemological equivalent of choosing to walk around blindfolded while declaring that you can see. But you cannot see. Reality is what it is, despite you trying to make it whatever you want it to be.</p>

<p>If you blind yourself to reality, then you cannot deal with it properly. You render yourself unable to deal with reality as it really is. </p>

<p>If you accept that morality is determined by the arbitrary decree from above, then you will never discover an objective morality in this world. You will never discover a proper moral code to guide your actions. When you cannot achieve happiness in the real world, you will have wasted your life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you accept that this life does not matter, then you will sacrifice everything in this life for happiness in the afterlife or the next life. This life will be a guardian of misery, which is what many religions teach. The thing is, this is the only life you get. If you squander this life in preparing for the next, this is all you get and you will have ruined your only life for nothing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the only life you get. Do not waste it on accepting arbitrary claims for no reason. Those ideas cannot help you achieve happiness in this world. No, they are more likely to frustrate you and to prevent you from achieving happiness in the only life you will ever get.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this is the great tragedy of every major religion; they encourage you to throw away your happiness in this world for happiness in the life after death. They encourage you to throw away your life in this world for nothing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every major religion of Earth is selling you the ultimate scam. Similar to those people demanding that you give your hard-earned money away for a timeshare you never get to use, religions are asking you to throw away your life for a cloud paradise that exists only on paper. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no life after death. This is all you get. Live your life for the sake of your happiness here on this Earth. Do not throw it away for the delusion of some unreachable paradise that you will never reach. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="justified-trust">Is Biblical Faith “Justified Trust”?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="597b">Some might think that by “faith” the Bible means “justified trust”.  Many people from other religions make this kind of claim. I am about to present several Bible verses to disprove this notion for Christianity. <br><br>One can study the religious texts of other religions, present similar evidence, and come to similar conclusions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="1ecd">The Bible never uses faith in the sense of justified trust. By faith, it means blindly believing things for no good reason and <em>against </em>all reason. It openly tells you <em>not</em> to see reality but to just <em>believe</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="68f8">Why does it do this? Because that is the only thing religions can offer anyone. Which is to have faith in empty assertions that have nothing to do with reality, empty assertions of promises beyond the observable world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="4f7a">That is why every religion always offers immaterial, unearthly rewards. Because they cannot offer anything that relates to reality. All it can do is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion">appeal to emotion</a> and irrational, baseless desires that have nothing to do with reality</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="4f7a">For it to  be justified trust, there would have to be a justification. Baseless appeals to emotions are not justifications. And therefore, Biblical faith is not justified trust. For that, they would require evidence and there is never any evidence for any of this. And  as we shall see, there is never supposed to be, that is the entire point of faith.</p>

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a command to do what the "LORD" says not because of the evidence of your senses, but because you fear an angry despot. Yes, the LORD says that he loves you. However, anyone that commands you to fear him does not really love you.</p>

Truth is not determined at the point of a gun nor by a lightning bolt from high above. No matter how much your god threatens you or claims to love you, the facts are what the facts are. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the emotional hook, the reason many choose to believe. Not because they see any reason to. But because they fear missing out on rewards after this life.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What matters is being at home with the Lord. For that, we must have faith and obey what he believes. Of course, since he does not exist, we have no way of knowing what he might want. But we can have faith in what we are told he wants. Which is what the clergy tells you he wants. </p>

<p>Thomas simply wanted some evidence of the resurrection. Jesus condemns him for expecting this and not having faith. Jesus condemns evidence and tells Thomas that faith is about blind acceptance for no reason. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="ddb5">We have seen that faith is the blind acceptance of empty assertions in the absence of proof or evidence. This blind acceptance leads people to reject reality and often to fight against it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We should note that a lack of faith is the one crime God will not forgive you for. Not blindly believing God for no reason is the ultimate sin, and blind obedience is the ultimate virtue. We will come back to this in a future article.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="2fba">Faith is what the Bible demands of its followers. Not justified trust, but blind acceptance of empty assertions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="9f60">Oh ye of faith, believe because the Book says so. Believe in it because God will reward you and if you do not, he will punish you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="d2a8">I don’t know about you, but I would rather deal with reality as it is. Impossible rewards and punishments will not hold me back. Live your life as you see fit, but I will live my life in this world. Not in the word of delusion offered by the Bible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What could it hurt? Faith demands that you blindly surrender your mind to the irrational demands of mystics. That you believe things for no reason. That you surrender objective morality to the arbitrary decrees of a despot. These things can only frustrate your attempt to gain happiness in this life, the only one you will ever have.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But religions tell you, that does not matter. Because after you are done with this life, there is something after death. But this is not so. And yet religions demand that you give up everything in this life for a fantasy world after death. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26334,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->

He is just as arbitrary as the Christian God...</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that is the great tragedy of faith; it demands that people surrender earthly values for nothing. You must accept things for no reason and frustrate your chance of happiness in this life. Indeed, you must give up happiness in this life for a fantasy, for nothing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is what faith does. It robs you of happiness in this world for nothing. Therefore, you should never exercise faith.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This applies in non-religious contexts too. Faith in anything is a cognitive dead-end. If you accept any claim for no reason, then it is cognitively useless. It can only serve as a roadblock in your mind that impedes a proper grasp of reality, as must all arbitrary claims. This too will impede your ability to deal with the world, and to some extent, make your happiness that much harder to achieve. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No good can ever come of accepting anything on faith. It can only impede your ability to grasp reality as it is and to deal with the world. It can only hinder your happiness. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no ghostly world waiting for you after this one. Make the most of this life, the only one you get. Don't throw it away for some fantasy cloud paradise. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is there any such thing as settled science? I am going to argue that there is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What do I mean by "settled" science? A scientific claim that any rational person would accept as true and established beyond any reasonable doubt. We do not expect such theories to be replaced by an alternate theory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You might object that this is not very scientific! We must always keep in mind that we might be wrong. We need to be ready to adjust what we know to accommodate new information that might cast what we know today into doubt. Keep in mind that we are fallible and that we might come to invalid conclusions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All knowledge, including science, is contextual. We study reality and, based on what we observe, we form logical conclusions. But we can only account for that we know about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, take Newtonian gravity. In the context of not knowing what happens near the speed of light, it was entirely reasonable to accept Newton's laws of gravity as settled science. We did not know what happened at extremely high velocities, so we had no reason to doubt Newtonian gravity. Newtonian gravity is valid, within the context of things not moving close to the speed of light. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We then expanded our context to account for things near light speed. We realized that in that context, Einstein’s relativity provides better mathematics for what happens with gravity at near light speed. Does that mean that we had no reason to be certain about Newtonian gravity? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, it does not. We knew it was an accurate description of gravity at speeds much lower than the speed of light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is why NASA uses Newtonian gravity for most purposes, even though relativistic equations would be more accurate. Newtonian gravity is easier to deal with and is extremely accurate at the speeds NASA works with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

So, Newton's gravity equations will work just fine thanks.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certainty is contextual. Suppose, in the context of our knowledge, the available evidence supports a theory. We should be certain about that theory. But what we are wrong? After all, we used to believe some strange things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We used to think things burned because of phlogiston. Phlogiston was a mysterious substance that was thought to exist in all combustible bodies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We used to think that dinosaurs were all sluggish, scaly critters that probably lived in swamps to support their massive weight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, sometimes we are wrong. Sometimes the facts do not support our theories. There are some theories that we have no business accepting as anything more than a plausible hypothesis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">These are the theories that do not make up the body of settled science. These are the theories we should not consider settled. </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would be dishonest to consider a theory settled in the absence of evidence. It would also be dishonest to consider a theory settled if we did not understand it well enough to be sure it was consistent with all the available evidence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some theories are entirely reasonable within the context of the available evidence. Sometimes all the known evidence points to these theories being true. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes we understand the theory well enough to conclude it is entirely consistent with the facts. If the facts are consistent with that theory and only that theory, then we can be certain that the theory in question is true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">We should not entertain serious doubts about theories that have substantial evidence behind them. </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can always <em>imagine</em> that we might disprove some theories. However, we should be certain about a theory if all the available evidence points to it being true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certainty does not require us to account for, by magic, for the possibility of a context of knowledge we do not currently possess. We can be certain that something is true even if there is something we do not know about now that may later show that it is not true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certainty is contextual, it is valid to be certain based on the context of available evidence. Provided that we are willing to address any evidence that arises, should the context of our knowledge change. We can be certain something is true. And yet adjust our theories when the context of our knowledge expands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there are theories that we can consider completely and forever settled. These are theories we know with certainty and can prove with no shadow of a doubt to be true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">We know these facts are true and that we cannot show them to be false.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would contradict known facts of reality if they were not true. Things would have to not be what we know they are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Examples of these would be that atoms exist. We know atoms exist; we have seen them. If they did not exist, almost everything we know about chemistry and atomic physics would not be true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We know evolution happens. We might not know everything about how it happens, but we know it does. If I wanted disprove evolution, we would have to invalidate almost everything we know about biology and the known facts of biology would have to be other than what they are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We know the Earth is round and that it orbits the Sun. To invalidate this, the direct evidence of our senses would have to be wrong! That we can see that the Earth is round would have to be fake. And how would we explain the observed behavior of Earth if it does not orbit the Sun? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":26164,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"media"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller.jpg"><img src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-26164"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It is much more scientific to think this might be real, right?</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can say without a shadow of a doubt that theories like this are absolutely and forever settled and that we will never find anything that contradicts them. No such evidence is even <a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/the-possible-and-the-impossible/" data-type="post" data-id="35">possible</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">We completely settled such science. It would be nonsensical to pretend otherwise!</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So yes, there is such a thing as settled science. It is foolish to pretend otherwise. And it would be intellectually dishonest and non-scientific to pretend that we have not settled this!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is unscientific to question that the Earth might not be round. Or that evolution does not happen. Or that atoms do not exist. Why? Because we have seen that the Earth is round! Are we to question the evidence of our senses so that we can become a Flattard?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would contradict the obvious implications of the evidence of our senses to believe atoms do not exist. Additionally, we have seen atoms! It would go against observable facts and their logical implications to question that evolution happens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would be unscientific to question that light behaves like a wave. This would go against the evidence of our senses and the logical implications of that evidence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To question theories we can show are irrefutable facts based on the evidence of our senses and the logical implications of such, is unscientific.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Your belief that the irrefutable facts of reality might be wrong is completely nonsensical and unscientific. </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ability to entertain alternatives to the way reality works is not indicative of science. It is closer to the mindset of the religious person that must evade reality to maintain the possibility of his delusions. The questioning of everything, even things we can prove beyond any reasonable doubt, is little better than those that deny science outright. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To deny the absolute certainty of that which we can show beyond any reasonable doubt, is to either partially deny the veracity of the evidence or fail to understand that science is about the study of an objective reality, not blind guesswork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:nextpage -->
<!--nextpage-->
<!-- /wp:nextpage -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It does no good to try to invalidate logic. Logic is the process of non-contradictory identification. Despite what modern philosophy asserts, it is not the process of arbitrarily making up connections between things. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the context of science, we use logic to analyze the evidence of our senses and identify which facts of reality that implies. And what those implications imply and what those imply and so forth. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Building up and sideways as we identify more and more facts of reality. And integrating what we observe with what we can deduce in an ever-tightening spiral.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why then do people say we do not have settled science? People do, including many alleged champions of science and reason.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is largely due to the philosophical influence of philosophers like Hume. Hume and others like to attack the validity of certainty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hume's epistemology goes much like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By this means, all knowledge degenerates into probability; and this probability is greater or less, according to our experience of the veracity or deceitfulness of our understanding, and according to the simplicity or intricacy of the question.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>David Hume, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Treatise_of_Human_Nature">A Treatise of Human Nature</a></em>, Book 1, Part 4, Section 1</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Want more proof that Hume is against certainty? See below. He attacks the process of induction by trying to assert it is baseless to infer anything about the future from the past!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For all inferences from experience, suppose, as their foundation, that the future will resemble the past, and that similar powers will be conjoined with similar sensible qualities. If there be any suspicion that the course of nature may change, and that the past may be no rule for the future. All experience becomes useless and can give rise to no inference or conclusion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is impossible, therefore, that any arguments from experience can prove this resemblance of the past to the future, since all these arguments are founded on the supposition of that resemblance. Let the course of things be allowed hitherto ever so regular; that alone, without some new argument or inference, proves not that, for the future, it will continue so. In vain, do you pretend to have learned the nature of bodies from your past experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>David Hume, <em>An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</em>, Cause and Effect, Part I</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">As we see, Hume believed that what is true today might not be true tomorrow!</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, if you put it this way, people might think you are talking nonsense. They are unlikely to think that the nature of reality changes from one day to another!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This kind of philosophy still influences people.  They believe that we cannot be certain about anything. This kind of philosophy has led them to think that the human mind is just too fallible to be sure that the human mind can grasp the truth.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kant reinforced this by trying to assert that we do not observe things as they are, but only as they appear to our senses. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The result of this is an implicit distrust of our senses and the belief that what we observe can always be akin to an illusion! </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we cannot even be sure about the evidence of our senses, then what reason do we have to be certain about anything? No, you have no reason to be certain about anything if you accept this baseless premise. This is baseless. We do have reasons to be certain about some theories. Theories that we can prove to be true based on the facts of reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just because you want to assert that "we might know better tomorrow" does not mean that we cannot be certain today. Not if we understand where the evidence points. Especially when it comes to theories that we know for a fact must be true, without any possibility of it being otherwise. Just because you can imagine an alternative to irrefutable facts, is no reason to entertain that it is a possible alternative. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Your ability to imagine that something is true does not make it a possibility.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If something is truly settled, that means that if it were not true, it would contradict the facts of reality. But contradictions do not exist. Therefore, it would be absurd to assume that settled science is anything but settled!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if you do not understand that some theories are settled beyond any reasonable doubt, they are still settled. Even if you want to pretend that reality is not what it is and that there is any possibility that it could be otherwise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to pretend that irrefutable facts are not what they are and that reality is not what we know it is, that is your business. It is very scientific to accept that some science is settled.<mark class="annotation-text annotation-text-yoast" id="annotation-text-13356c66-0607-4cd9-922d-9946b36966d9"></mark> It is unscientific to assert that it is not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To wrap up, here is a bonus picture of a manganese atom. Some people think the existence of atoms is not settled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Today we shall see that the cause of 9/11 is Islamic idealogy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:simpletoc/toc {"use_ol":true,"updated":1668983809215} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the Western values of reason and individuality were attacked by Islam, stood the twin towers of the World Trade Center. These mighty structures were icons of New York City, and they stood tall and proud. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before 9/11, the twin towers stood as a symbol of the heights achievable by the efforts of reasoning individuals, who value productivity, self-esteem (ego), and rationality. They were a symbol of what is achievable by individuals in a culture that values freedoms and individual rights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Much like the Statue of Liberty, they were symbols of Western values. A symbol of the American Dream rooted in every individual's right to:</p>

<p>The American dream is that:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-february-26-1993-islam-attacks">February 26, 1993 - Islam Attacks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the first terrorist attack on these values came on February 26, 1993. An Islamic militant, Ramzi Yousef cowardly attacked Western values. Hus Islamic ideology killed six people and injured a further 1,042 people.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the 1998 trial, Yousef condemned the United States for its American Victory over Japan in 1945 and its economic embargo against a rights-violating Cuba. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Well, when you were the first one who invented this terrorism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>Ramzi Yousef, Wikipedia.</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, Yousef clearly drops context and pretends the military defense of a nation is equivalent to terrorism if it involves the loss of innocent lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, nobody that understands the moral justification of warfare would say such a thing. It is a moral imperative for a moral nation to engage in warfare with enemy nations and to inflict crushing military defeat upon them. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This always involves the loss of innocent lives. It is not feasible to expect to win a war against an enemy state without the loss of innocent lives in enemy nations. The blame for the loss of these innocent belongs to the enemy state. It is the enemy state that made the war necessary. The enemy state made it necessary to choose between innocent lives in the enemy state, or the loss of innocent lives in the nation defending itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the extent to which those innocent lives exist is not as great as most people think. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is immoral to equate warfare against an enemy state, a war of self-defense, with terrorism. To defend your nation against destruction by an enemy state can in no sense be equivalent to terrorism.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The alternative was a bloody invasion of the Japanese mainland that would have required the loss of over a million American lives, enormous expense, the destruction of much of Japan and the loss of millions of Japanese lives. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So it is that even the Japanese came to be thankful that the Americans found an alternative to an invasion of Japan that would have virtually destroyed Japan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We must not judge the morality of a nation by the number of times it goes to war. There are legitimate reasons America may have needed to engage in war in self-defense. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One can argue that many of the wars America has been involved in, such as the war in Vietnam or Iraq, were not justified in defending American interests but were altruistic campaigns. This is a legitimate reason to condemn America for many of its invasions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there is no legitimate reason to condemn America for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They were a moral necessity as soon as Japan threatened America's values of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>Yousef condemns America for acts of violence and terrorism. He condemns America for acts of war and violence and for inventing terrorism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet, Islam was engaging in religious terrorism long before the United States existed. It certainly did not invent terrorism, but it advocated terrorism long before America existed and long before modern Western culture existed.</p>

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Quran predates America and modern Western culture. So, in what sense did the West invent terrorism? The Quran was clearly advocating terrorism long before America or the modern Western world was.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Quran has many verses like the ones given above. Not one of them says that a true Muslim shall spare heretic imprisonment or a violent death!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yousef is acting just as the Quran, as Islam demands. Let us look at another quote:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This verse clearly criticizes peaceful Muslims! It holds those willing to strike the nonbeliever as morally superior to those that refuse to do so!</p>

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook calls this truth "cruel and insensitive".&nbsp;Facebook likes to shield people from being offended for their religious views.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, no rational person should attempt to shield someone from such offenses. If one chooses to be religious, then one should not be spared any <strong>non-violent</strong> attack on their religion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="http://localhost/rational/the-absurdity-of-faith/" data-type="post" data-id="657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Religion</a> is worthy of ridicule and attack. It is irrational and anti-life and if you embrace religion; you have no business expecting reasonable people to respect your religious sensitivities. Neither Facebook nor anyone else has any business trying to shield people from criticism of their religious views. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook disagrees. It believes Islam and its followers should be spared offense and the indignity of reality. In doing so, Facebook is effectively in league with a cult of murderous, woman-hating pedophiles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, what is the proper response to Islam? To ideologically expose it for what it is, a genocidal, women-hating cult of child abuse and pro-slavery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not a religion of peace, and if you read the Quran, it never pretends to be. No truly devout Muslim with any knowledge of the religion would say that it is. No rational person could ever maintain that contradiction if they read a significant portion of a book that frequently calls for murder for the crime of heresy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-islam-is-fundamentally-a-cult-of-violent-oppression-and-genocide-against-heretics-we-cannot-remove-this-from-the-religion-without-creating-a-fundamentally-different-religion">Islam is fundamentally a cult of violent oppression and genocide against heretics. </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We cannot remove this from the religion without creating a fundamentally different religion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(Which is why those practicing Allah-worshiping sects that do not advocate violence are not practicing truly Islamic religions. They are at most offshoots of Islam and are certainly not the same Islamic religion being talked about in this article).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since Islam fundamentally demands the constant violent slaughter of non-believers, it cannot be a religion of peace, and the <strong>truly devout</strong> must be mass murderers or support mass murder. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-those-rejecting-to-practice-this-tenet-of-the-religion-are-not-truly-devout-practitioners-of-islam">Those rejecting to practice this tenet of the religion are not truly devout practitioners of Islam. </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They should stop pretending they are true practitioners of Islam. It is these "moderate" practitioners who lend Islam a pretense of peace. This leads to the sanction of the victims of a dangerous, murderous cult. Because any individual who dares to criticize the religion itself is then called an Islamophobe and a hater of all Muslims, inciting to kill all Muslims, even in the Western World and so on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Islam, in all its naked truth, is an ideology that teaches the violent slaughter of non-believers. Anything else is heresy against Allah! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is right, not supporting the violent slaughter of non-believers is heresy. Yet, we are meant to support this religion and consider it a religion of peace?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By this standard, then we might as well embrace the death cult of Charles Manson as a peace cult. Are Manson's views legitimate and worthy of respect? No. Then, neither are those of Islam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Respecting Islam because it is a religion is no more legitimate than accepting the validity of Manson's cult views. There is no fundamental difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To support Islam just because it is a religion is no better than supporting Manson’s apocalyptic death cult. And no amount of people being offended by this can alter this fact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we respect reality and life, then we must see Islam as an enemy of both. We must accept it as the genocidal death cult that it is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Western World must not allow Islam to pose a serious threat to the Western World. We must stand up to it and declare it as the enemy of life, liberty, reason and freedom that it is. Even if it means we must wipe all the Islamic States from existence, we must not allow any Islamic State to threaten the West. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-to-allow-islamic-states-to-threaten-the-west-is-an-act-of-cowardice">To allow Islamic States to threaten the West is an act of cowardice.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, we have a problem. The West refuses to accept that any religion can be the enemy. Why? Because most Western nations have one religion or another and are thus unwilling to accept that religion can be a problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As long as the West embraces religion, it is unlikely that they will ever be able to declare war against another religion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that is exactly what we must do. We must accept that religion is evil, every religion. The entire concept of religion is the embrace of evil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is the willful denial of reality in preference for baseless fantasy and emotion, which is the core of all evil. In this respect, all religions are fundamentally irrational and evil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-if-we-hold-that-religion-is-anything-but-evil-then-we-cannot-identify-that-any-religion-is-the-enemy-we-must-fight">If we hold that religion is anything but evil, then we cannot identify that any religion is the enemy we must fight.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As long as we grant that any religion is somehow valid, then we can and will grant that Islam too is valid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will pretend that Islam has some business existing and that it only needs to have the violence purged from it. As long as our culture believes that any religion has any business existing, it cannot identify another religion as an ideological enemy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It may identify aspects of the religion as evil, but it will never allow itself to identify the religion itself as fundamentally immoral and evil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because once you accept Islam as evil, then you must accept all religion as fundamentally corrupt and evil. Every religion, whether it is Islam, Hinduism or Christianity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We must show the Islamic world that it has no power to destroy us if we do not let it and that without us, it is a collection of murderous savages that have no power to destroy the Western World.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We must wage war against Islam with every shred of military might we have. Until we reveal every Islamic State that opposes us for what it is, a bunch of desperate, cowardly savages. We must show them that to oppose is to court death and that Islam has no power in the West.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That it cannot, despite what it wishes, destroy or take over the culture of the West. A culture that knows what it is; a death cult embraced by murderous barbarians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anything else is cowardice and the refusal to face an abundantly clear threat. To embrace Islam as worthy of cultural protection or even as somehow equivalent to Western culture is to abandon reason, and life and embrace death and barbarism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may choose to embrace death and barbarism. And until the West identifies religion as the problem that it is that the West will continue to do so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-we-are-not-saying-that-people-do-not-have-the-right-to-practice-religion">We are not saying that people do not have the right to practice religion. </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it becomes a problem when it enters politics, and it is forced upon others. It becomes a problem when is used as an excuse for crimes and violations of individual rights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then you do not get to hide behind your religion. Then you are treated as the criminal you are. The evil ideologies of religion you hold are treated as the evil they are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are not saying that we should kill all Muslims or all religious people.&nbsp;No, but we should oppose religious fundamentalism for what it is - the true expression of its religion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-we-must-oppose-islamic-states-the-west-must-show-that-religion-has-no-ethical-or-political-power-in-its-lands">We must oppose Islamic States. The West must show that religion has no ethical or political power in its lands.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We must show that we will not allow terrorists to kill while hiding behind religious freedom. Anything else is to surrender our right to our lives and is a form of prolonged suicide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The West must make it clear that there is no tolerance for those using religion to justify the violation of individual rights. That there is to be no tolerance of religion rearing its head in political avenues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leave us alone and we will leave you alone to worship death and ruin your own life with evil ideologies in the privacy of your own homes and temples.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After all, that is the beauty of a free society. You get freedoms. That includes the freedom to ruin your own life as you choose. That is the beauty of Western values, you have the right to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness". You have the right to "pursue" happiness. You do not have the right to claim on other people to provide it to you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You get the freedom to take responsibility for your own life! You get the freedom to make your own bad decisions and face the consequences of your ideologies and actions. And you do not get to force them on anyone else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you choose to force those ideologies upon anyone else, if you choose to terrorize anyone else in the name of those ideologies, then you shall be cut down!</p>
