Designed to pacify Messianic Jews and to integrate them into Roman society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might not seem to be an important subject or a probable claim, but it really is. If Christianity and its proper place in the history of the West is to be understood, it is important that the true nature of Christianity is understood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, is this claim true? Yes, as you will discover when you listen to the podcast and or read the transcript.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/CreatingChrist.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of the Creating Christ book.\" class=\"wp-image-26420\" width=\"263\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/CreatingChrist.jpg 350w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/CreatingChrist-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"htoc-episode-transcript\">Episode Transcript<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This episode is about one hour and fifty-six minutes long.

I am the co-author of the new book &#8220;Creating Christ: How Roman Emperors invented Christianity&#8221;.<br><br>Basically, it takes on what would certainly strike most people today, certainly most Christians today, as a rather outrageous thesis. That in fact, the New Testament is Roman propaganda. That when it was originally written, it was written with a certain political agenda. As well as a certain theological agenda.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most Christians would think that is crazy. They regard Christianity as the very opposite of Roman philosophy. They believe that the Romans persecuted Christianity. Hollywood has certainly convinced them that in the last century. But, there&#8217;s a forgotten history here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two thousand years ago, there was cataclysmic war between the Roman Empire and Jewish Messianic rebels. And the rebellion was largely motivated by religious factors. It was that war, that cataclysmic war, that destroyed the temple, for example. Reduced it to the Wailing Wall that it is today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is difficult for me to imagine that Christianity emerging at that very same moment in history is just an accident. And when we started our research, we found nothing to contradict our theory. And then we found some remarkable physical evidence which basically demonstrated it.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"237\" height=\"240\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/coin_Roman-propaganda.jpg\" alt=\"Roman coin.\" class=\"wp-image-26421\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/coin_Roman-propaganda.jpg 237w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/coin_Roman-propaganda-70x70.jpg 70w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Like many Roman coins were, Christianity is naked Roman propaganda.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>In short, the thesis is that what we have in the New Testament is Roman propaganda written 2000 years ago to quell the Jewish revolt. That is very much the 30,000-foot level of analysis. Or I should say 10,000-meter level, from New Zealand. [footnote]Dwayne and Ashna were living in New Zealand when this was recorded[\/footnote]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, from way up in the sky, looking down on it, the way to really look at it is that the moral idealism that we read in the New Testament is really a form of political propaganda.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also regarded as moral idealism, both by Christians and even by secular people who have adopted it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And having forgotten the original context of the New Testament&#8217;s creation, it&#8217;s very easy to detach ourselves from that. And to think of the doctrine of Jesus Christ as sort of an unworldly, non-earthly form of moral idealism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when you just change the angle slightly and you look at the entire New Testament from this new angle, suddenly everything is explained. We were simply blown away, I think when we started pulling that string because nothing contradicted it. And all the evidence seemed to confirm it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna: Does it matter how Christianity got started? Why does that matter to us now?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James:<\/strong> Well, that&#8217;s a fair question. This is 2000-year-old history and Christianity has certainly changed considerably. At least it&#8217;s operative doctrines have. The New Testament itself obviously has not changed, but the way Christians understand and live those doctrines has dramatically changed over the last 2000 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a very good question. Why should we even care? Well, there are two very good answers to that. History matters. And particularly the history of ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human beings are really motivated by their ideas and their history can be understood in terms of the power of ideas. Although these ideas are 2000 years old, they literally reach across the millennia and control our psychologies, our view of what&#8217;s morally right and wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even people who are secular, people who tend to be on political left and who don&#8217;t have much of a religion, have basically adopted Christian social ethics is their own. Socialists and Communists have basically applied the ethics and the social doctrine of the New Testament in a very consistentway. While simply leaving out all the mystical and miraculous stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the values and the ideas expressed in the New Testament are still a living vital, powerful force. On the American left, they have adopted elements of pacifism, social altruism and concern for the poor above other considerations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discovery, whether you&#8217;re religious or not, that the moral idealism of Christianity is in fact simply a form of political propaganda, is crucially important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying that that every single thing in the New Testament is to be thrown out. I&#8217;m just saying that it needs to be re-evaluated. Every single moral doctrine in the New Testament needs to be re-evaluated in this light, rather than simply assumed as the moral ideal that it is held to be and<br>which is still controlling people today.<br><br>It seems to me that at one level it is important to understand that the New Testament isn&#8217;t history. Scholars for the last 200 years have determined that the New Testament is not reliable history.<br><br>I think it&#8217;s even far more powerful and far more important to identify what the New Testament actually is and to place it within its contemporary political and cultural context. Like we do any other literature or doctrine.<br><br>Once you do that, understanding what it is, is I think far more persuasive than simply saying it is not reliable.<br><br>In other words, if Jesus tells you to turn the other cheek, is that really the best policy, in light of the fact  that it was written in order to pacify rebels 2000 years ago?<br><br>We can see the agenda behind saying \u201cTurn the other cheek\u201d or \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers\u201d, etc. But before we simply adopt that as a more as our moral code, we need to understand the real motives behind the people that wrote those things.<br><br><strong>Ashna: Are there any modern parallels and can we apply what happened then to anything happening now?<\/strong><br><br><strong>James:<\/strong> Oh, very much so. In fact, the same basic conflict that we are discussing in the book, that cataclysmic war between the Roman Empire and Jewish Messianic zealots is still in a way, still playing out today.<br><br>The entire religion of Islam can I believe, be traced to the extreme monotheistic zealots of the first-century. The war between Rome and the Jewish rebels stratified Judaism of the first-century into three surviving religions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"510\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/SeigeofJeruseleum.jpg\" alt=\"Painting of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70AD.\" class=\"wp-image-26423\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/SeigeofJeruseleum.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/SeigeofJeruseleum-300x191.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/SeigeofJeruseleum-768x490.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70AD &#8212;\na painting by David Roberts (1796-1849).<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rabbinic Judaism which survives today. And which greatly deemphasized the entire concept of Messiah. And which therefore reduced the political threat that Judaism might represent to foreign governments as Jews were living in diaspora as minorities and various Christian or Islamic cultures. Including Christianity, which is a sort of pro-Roman peaceful response to Jewish Messianic activities in the first-century.<br><br>And then of course, the Jewish rebels themselves, which never went away. They simply transformed over the centuries into Islam. The Islamic terrorism of today is in effect the same conflict of 2000 years ago. Western civilization in effect is still beating back a violent form of Eastern monotheism. In effect, we&#8217;re fighting the same battle 2000 years later.<br><br>And the irony is that our response is very similar today. Western political leaders, for example, assure us that Islam means peace. That Islam commands peace and that Jihad is an internal conflict, not an actual rebellion. And in so doing, they&#8217;re doing in effect precisely what the Romans did in creating Christianity.<br><br>The Romans said that Jewish Messianic religion is in effect a pacifistic religion. One that says, cooperate with political leaders, pay your taxes and turn the other cheek.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna: What about Roman persecution? Didn&#8217;t they feed Christians to the lions? If not, why do you think this is widely believed?<\/strong><br><br><strong>James:<\/strong> The Roman Empire was a remarkably tolerant government when it came to foreign religions, comparatively speaking. They obviously did not have what we in the West today call freedom of religion or freedom of conscience.<br><br>There was religious persecution. Remember, politics and religion were joined at the hip in those days. There were political implications to any religious idea and there were religious implications to most political ideas.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Romans tried to be as tolerant as to as many foreign cults and religions as they possibly could. And so, persecution was not the norm within the Roman Empire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this Jewish War that I was referring to earlier was a major ideological challenge to the Romans. Jewish monotheism forbade them, for example, from participating in any kind of acknowledgement of Roman state deities. Which Romans thought just a perfunctory part of joining their empire and which other polytheistic cultures had no problem doing.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"319\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/319px-Vulcan_Coustou_Louvre_MR1814.jpg\" alt=\"Status of Vulcan (Hephaestus). \" class=\"wp-image-26424\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/319px-Vulcan_Coustou_Louvre_MR1814.jpg 319w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/319px-Vulcan_Coustou_Louvre_MR1814-199x300.jpg 199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Romans were known to adopt deities from other pantheons. Here is Vulcan, the Roman version of the Greek god Hephaestus.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Many of the Jews, with their strict form monotheism, found it difficult to participate in Roman society generally. Therefore, at first, the Romans tried to create exemptions for the Hebrews, exempting them from Emperor worship or public worship of Roman state deities.<br><br>Nonetheless, any connection with foreigners, any contact with foreigners, began to be regarded as pollution by the more extreme elements among the Hebrews.<br><br>And simultaneously, the Romans began to see the Jews in various antisemitic ways. And the conflict became inevitable.<br><br>There were continuous disturbances. Outbreaks of rebellion and riots in Alexandria, in Egypt and in Rome itself. Until finally in 66 open rebellion broke out in Judea itself, climaxing in the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. Decades later in the early second-century, still a second Jewish war would break out.<br><br>Now, those Jews who were leaders of this movement, religious and political leaders, rebel leaders, were obviously heavily persecuted by the Romans. Romans crucified them in the thousands. They tortured them for information.<br><br>The Romans were not boy scouts, they were ruthless conquerors. So, there was persecution and indeed the persecution of Messianic Jews in the first two centuries.<br><br>Christianity is an offshoot of Messianic Judaism and has adopted that persecution as their own, although what we call Christianity is an entirely different doctrine.<br><br>In fact, in many ways, the very opposite doctrine of the Jewish rebels. The rebels believed in the prophecies of the Old Testament that says the Messiah would come and liberate them in, at such times of foreign oppression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>End of excerpt. <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/transcripts\/episode_ten.pdf\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/transcripts\/episode_ten.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Click here to download the PDF transcript.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today we interview James Valliant, author of the important book &#8220;Creating Christ: How Roman Emperors Invented Christianity&#8221;. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":26461,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[762,368,370,371,376,384],"tags":[778,435,455,484,494,555,635,685,689,690],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/645"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/13"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=645"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/645\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":26522,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/645\/revisions\/26522"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/26461"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=645"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=645"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=645"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
