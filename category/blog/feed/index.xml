<p>Before the Western values of reason and individuality were attacked by Islam, stood the twin towers of the World Trade Center. These mighty structures were icons of New York City, and they stood tall and proud. </p>



<p>Before 9/11, the twin towers stood as a symbol of the heights achievable by the efforts of reasoning individuals, who value productivity, self-esteem (ego), and rationality. They were a symbol of what is achievable by individuals in a culture that values freedoms and individual rights.</p>



<p>Much like the Statue of Liberty, they were symbols of Western values. A symbol of the American Dream rooted in every individual&#8217;s right to:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p id="htoc-life-liberty-and-the-pursuit-of-happiness">&#8220;Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&#8221;</p>
<cite>DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</cite></blockquote>



<p>The American dream is that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p id="htoc-life-should-be-better-and-richer-and-fuller-for-everyone-with-opportunity-for-each-according-to-ability-or-achievement"> Life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement. </p>
<cite>James Adams, 1931.</cite></blockquote>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-february-26-1993-islam-attacks">February 26, 1993 &#8211; Islam Attacks</h2>


<p>One of the first terrorist attack on these values came on February 26, 1993. An Islamic militant, Ramzi Yousef cowardly attacked Western values. Hus Islamic ideology killed six people and injured a further 1,042 people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the 1998 trial, Yousef condemned the United States for its American Victory over Japan in 1945 and its economic embargo against a rights-violating Cuba. &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p id="htoc-you-keep-talking-also-about-collective-punishment-and-killing-innocent-people-to-force-governments-to-change-their-policies-you-call-this-terrorism-when-someone-would-kill-innocent-people-or-civilians-in-order-to-force-the-government-to-change-its-policies-well-when-you-were-the-first-one-who-invented-this-terrorism">You keep talking also about collective punishment and killing innocent people to force governments to change their policies; you call this terrorism when someone would kill innocent people or civilians in order to force the government to change its policies. Well, when you were the first one who invented this terrorism.</p>
<cite>Ramzi Yousef, Wikipedia.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Here, Yousef clearly drops context and pretends the military defense of a nation is equivalent to terrorism if it involves the loss of innocent lives.</p>



<p>However, nobody that understands the moral justification of warfare would say such a thing. It is a moral imperative for a moral nation to engage in warfare with enemy nations and to inflict crushing military defeat upon them. </p>



<p>This always involves the loss of innocent lives. It is not feasible to expect to win a war against an enemy state without the loss of innocent lives in enemy nations. The blame for the loss of these innocent belongs to the enemy state. It is the enemy state that made the war necessary. The enemy state made it necessary to choose between innocent lives in the enemy state, or the loss of innocent lives in the nation defending itself.</p>



<p>However, the extent to which those innocent lives exist is not as great as most people think. </p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-most-tyrants-gain-power-by-the-consent-of-the-people-and-thus-the-population-is-guilty-of-making-such-tyranny-possible">Most tyrants gain power by the consent of the people, and thus the population is guilty of making such tyranny possible. </h3>


<p>It is immoral to equate warfare against an enemy state, a war of self-defense, with terrorism. To defend your nation against destruction by an enemy state can in no sense be equivalent to terrorism.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p id="htoc-you-were-the-first-one-who-killed-innocent-people-and-you-are-the-first-one-who-introduced-this-type-of-terrorism-to-the-history-of-mankind-when-you-dropped-an-atomic-bomb-which-killed-tens-of-thousands-of-women-and-children-in-japan-and-when-you-killed-over-a-hundred-thousand-people-most-of-them-civilians-in-tokyo-with-fire-bombings">You were the first one who killed innocent people, and you are the first one who introduced this type of terrorism to the history of mankind when you dropped an atomic bomb which killed tens of thousands of women and children in Japan and when you killed over a hundred thousand people, most of them civilians, in Tokyo with fire bombings. </p>

And you killed civilians in Vietnam with chemicals, as with the so-called Agent Orange. You killed civilians and innocent people, not soldiers, innocent people every single war you went. You went to wars more than any other country in this century, and then you have the nerve to talk about killing innocent people.</p>
<cite>Ramzi Yousef, Wikipedia </cite></blockquote>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-the-nuclear-bombs-dropped-upon-japan-were-an-act-of-heroism">The nuclear bombs dropped upon Japan were an act of heroism. </h3>


<p>The alternative was a bloody invasion of the Japanese mainland that would have required the loss of over a million American lives, enormous expense, the destruction of much of Japan and the loss of millions of Japanese lives. </p>



<p>So it is that even the Japanese came to be thankful that the Americans found an alternative to an invasion of Japan that would have virtually destroyed Japan.</p>



<p>We must not judge the morality of a nation by the number of times it goes to war. There are legitimate reasons America may have needed to engage in war in self-defense. </p>

<p>One can argue that many of the wars America has been involved in, such as the war in Vietnam or Iraq, were not justified in defending American interests but were altruistic campaigns. This is a legitimate reason to condemn America for many of its invasions.</p>



<p>But there is no legitimate reason to condemn America for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They were a moral necessity as soon as Japan threatened America&#8217;s values of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

You are liars, butchers, and hypocrites. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramzi_Yousef#cite_note-FullExcerpt-29">[29]</a></sup></p>
<cite>Ramzi Yousef, Wikipedia</cite></blockquote>



<p>Yousef condemns America for acts of violence and terrorism. He condemns America for acts of war and violence and for inventing terrorism.</p>



<p>Yet, Islam was engaging in religious terrorism long before the United States existed. It certainly did not invent terrorism, but it advocated terrorism long before America existed and long before modern Western culture existed.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-the-quran-contains-at-least-109-verses-describing-war-with-nonbelievers-many-are-quite-graphic-and-describe-things-such-as-the-decapitation-of-the-nonbeliever">The Quran contains at least 109 verses describing war with nonbelievers.</h3>


<p>Many of the verses are quite graphic and describe things such as the decapitation of the nonbeliever. </p>



<p>Here are some of them:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p id="htoc-as-to-those-who-reject-faith-i-will-punish-them-with-terrible-agony-in-this-world-and-in-the-hereafter-nor-will-they-have-anyone-to-help"><em>As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.</em></p>
<cite>Quran 3:56</cite></blockquote>



<p>Seems a clear condemnation of the so-called &#8220;crime&#8221; of non-belief.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p id="htoc-the-punishment-of-those-who-wage-war-against-allah-and-his-messenger-and-strive-to-make-mischief-in-the-land-is-only-this-that-they-should-be-murdered-or-crucified-or-their-hands-and-their-feet-should-be-cut-off-on-opposite-sides-or-they-should-be-imprisoned-this-shall-be-as-a-disgrace-for-them-in-this-world-and-in-the-hereafter-they-shall-have-a-grievous-chastisement"><em>The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter, they shall have a grievous chastisement</em></p>
<cite>Quran 5:33</cite></blockquote>



<p>And then there is this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p id="htoc-remember-when-your-lord-inspired-the-angels-i-will-cast-terror-into-the-hearts-of-those-who-disbelieve-therefore-strike-off-their-heads-and-strike-off-every-fingertip-of-them"><em>&#8220;(Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels&#8230; &#8220;I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore, strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them&#8221;</em></p>
<cite>Quran 8:12</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Quran predates America and modern Western culture. So, in what sense did the West invent terrorism? The Quran was clearly advocating terrorism long before America or the modern Western world was.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-the-truth-is-that-islam-is-a-death-worshiping-cult-of-widespread-genocide">The truth is that Islam is a death-worshiping cult of widespread genocide. </h3>


<p>During the trial of Yousef, Judge Duffy did not morally condemn Islam for its death worship. He apologized for Islam and faith. </p>

<p>Duffy did not condemn the sacrifice collection of such cults and religions. Duffy condemned the ego, the very Western values that had made the twin towers possible!</p>

<cite>Judge Duffy, Wikipedia</cite></blockquote>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-but-we-have-seen-that-according-to-the-quran-itself-yousef-was-acting-entirely-consistent-with-the-quran">But we have seen that according to the Quran itself, Yousef was acting entirely consistent with the Quran. </h3>


<p>The Quran has many verses like the ones given above. Not one of them says that a true Muslim shall spare heretic imprisonment or a violent death!</p>



<p>Yousef is acting just as the Quran, as Islam demands. Let us look at another quote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p id="htoc-not-equal-are-those-of-the-believers-who-sit-at-home-except-those-who-are-disabled-by-injury-or-are-blind-or-lame-etc-and-those-who-strive-hard-and-fight-in-the-cause-of-allah-with-their-wealth-and-their-lives-allah-has-preferred-in-grades-those-who-strive-hard-and-fight-with-their-wealth-and-their-lives-above-those-who-sit-at-home-unto-each-allah-has-promised-good-paradise-but-allah-has-preferred-those-who-strive-hard-and-fight-above-those-who-sit-at-home-by-a-huge-reward"><em>Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward &#8220;</em></p>
<cite>Quran 4:95</cite></blockquote>



<p>This verse clearly criticizes peaceful Muslims! It holds those willing to strike the nonbeliever as morally superior to those that refuse to do so!</p>

<p id="d19e">In this article, I am going to show that religious faith is unreasonable, and that no honest person should ever exercise faith. We can make very similar arguments about other kinds of faith. However, we will focus on religious faith.</p>

<p id="63a2">I define faith as:</p>

<p id="htoc-the-blind-acceptance-of-assertions-in-the-absence-of-any-evidence-or-proof-based-on-the-emotional-desire-for-that-assertion-to-be-true"><em>The blind acceptance of assertions in the absence of any evidence or proof, based on the emotional desire for that assertion to be true.</em></p>
<cite>Dwayne Davies</cite></blockquote>



<p id="17ba">The only claims of any merit are those that help us achieve some good value or another. That value might be to understand how to deal with the world around you and stay alive. It might be how to get lots of money and buy that house you want. It could be any value that you might imagine. </p>



<p id="17ba">However, for a value and claim to be of worth, it must help us achieve some purpose based on reality. If not, of what use could it possibly be to anyone?</p>



<p>To achieve good values, we must deal with the world as it really is. We must understand how the world works and deal with reality as it is. Only the things that help us do this help us to achieve values. Therefore, in order to help us achieve values in the real world, a claim must have a valid relation to the world. It must have some relation to observable facts. If not, then it is impossible for it to have any merit. That which has no relation to the real world is useless in achieving values. </p>



<p>If we are going to make or evaluate claims about reality, the only ones that are of any use in achieving values are those that correspond with reality. Truth is correspondence with reality. Truth is that which corresponds to the way things are. Therefore, the only claim that has any merit is that which has some truth to it.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="500" height="419" src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/firmament500.jpg" alt="Earth under a dome (the firmament)." class="wp-image-26326" srcset="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/firmament500.jpg 500w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/firmament500-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Bible seems to think the Earth is flat and with a over it. Possibly with stars embedded into the dome. But we should not take its word for any of that, should we?</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But how do we know whether a claim is true? You must first establish the possibility of the claim. If we make a claim, we should establish that there is some evidence or proof behind it. If you make an assertion without evidence, we cannot show it to correspond to reality. That assertion is, therefore, entirely without merit.</p>



<p>How do we establish whether something is possible? We discuss that in <a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/the-possible-and-the-impossible/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://dwaynedavies.com/the-possible-and-the-impossible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article on possibility.</a> Indeed, we took much of this section from that article.</p>



<p>To summarize that article, before we take any claim seriously, we must first establish that there is some evidence that it might be true. Otherwise, it is a waste of time considering it. </p>



<p id="2b1f">If we make a claim, we should establish that there is some evidence or proof behind it. Why should anyone accept any claim in the absence of evidence? Why would anyone do this when it could have no objective value? </p>



<p>Because they want it to be true. They have no cognitive reason to want it to be true. That person simply feels that it is preferable for it to be true. They feel an emotional response to the assertions being made, which makes them want to believe that the assertion must be true. </p>



<p>There is no reason to accept something merely because you want it to be true. Emotions are not tools of cognition. A claim is not valid because you wish it to be so. </p>



<p>But that is what faith is, the acceptance of things for which there is no evidence or proof. Faith is, therefore, the acceptance of baseless assertions for no reason and because someone wants it to be true based on emotion. However, emotions are not a valid reason for believing something.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-harm">What is the Harm?</h2>


<p id="fba5">Faith and reality are always in conflict. So is virtually every claim accepted for no reason and defended against reason. Knowing the truth is not a trivial task. It requires careful observation of reality, serious thought and a dedication to understanding the facts for what they are. </p>



<p id="a0eb">Faith is the refusal to do any of that. Faith is the attempt to bypass thought and proceed directly to the truth by wishing empty assertions to be fact. As though wanting something to be true somehow makes it so.</p>



<p id="622c">Assertions accepted on faith are almost always wrong. There is no real chance that anything you believe for no reason corresponds to the facts. There is essentially no chance that your blind assertions are true.</p>

Condemns man for seeking an understanding of the world&#8230;</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Which is why the Bible is almost invariably wrong about everything. It is wrong about the shape of the Earth, and when it asserts that pi is exactly three. It is wrong when it pretends that Earth has a glass dome above it that lets the rain in. There are lots of other silly examples like this.</p>



<p>Therefore, almost everything every religion says about the universe is wrong. That is why their cosmologies are always wrong. That is why, when religions say what is right or wrong, they are frequently wrong.</p>



<p>Many religions prohibit things like theft or murder, in certain circumstances. The Bible includes commandments not to steal or murder. Most of us would agree that these are objectively wrong. These are examples of the few instances of things in the Bible that reasonable people might agree with.</p>



<p>However, the Bible does not forbid murder because of any valid reasoning. It does not forbid killing people because of any real respect for individual rights. It does this because it asserts God would not like this for reasons that are not entirely clear.  It is the same with stealing, which is not forbidden because of any arguments to do with property rights, but again for reasons that God does not make clear.</p>



<p>So even when it forbids things that reasonable people might consider wrong, it does not do so for valid reasons. Religions forbid things for invalid reasons and manage to once again prove that they are wrong. </p>



<p id="f195">Once you have rejected reality and embraced faith, what does that leave you to believe? Whatever you want to believe in, as long as we assume it blindly.</p>



<p id="63fe">Most often, this takes the form of whatever is emotionally satisfying or seems superficially easy to grasp. Or which provides moral guidance with little to no actual connection to how man should act to be happy and thrive.</p>



<p id="0e6a">But just because something is easy to understand does not mean that it is true. Something like the theory of a flat Earth might seem intuitive. However, the Earth is not flat. </p>



<p>It seemed intuitive to the Greeks that there were no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">irr</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ational numbers</a>. However, they were wrong and irrational numbers turn up all the time in mathematics. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Some people, including alleged champions of reason and science think that there is no such thing as settled science. Let's bust that unscientific nonsense.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Is there any such thing as settled science? I am going to argue that there is.</p>



<p>What do I mean by &#8220;settled&#8221; science? A scientific claim that any rational person would accept as true and established beyond any reasonable doubt. We do not expect such theories to be replaced by an alternate theory.</p>



<p>You might object that this is not very scientific! We must always keep in mind that we might be wrong. We need to be ready to adjust what we know to accommodate new information that might cast what we know today into doubt. Keep in mind that we are fallible and that we might come to invalid conclusions.</p>



<p>All knowledge, including science, is contextual. We study reality and, based on what we observe, we form logical conclusions. But we can only account for that we know about.</p>



<p>For instance, take Newtonian gravity. In the context of not knowing what happens near the speed of light, it was entirely reasonable to accept Newton&#8217;s laws of gravity as settled science. We did not know what happened at extremely high velocities, so we had no reason to doubt Newtonian gravity. Newtonian gravity is valid, within the context of things not moving close to the speed of light. </p>



<p>We then expanded our context to account for things near light speed. We realized that in that context, Einstein’s relativity provides better mathematics for what happens with gravity at near light speed. Does that mean that we had no reason to be certain about Newtonian gravity? </p>



<p>No, it does not. We knew it was an accurate description of gravity at speeds much lower than the speed of light.</p>



<p>That is why NASA uses Newtonian gravity for most purposes, even though relativistic equations would be more accurate. Newtonian gravity is easier to deal with and is extremely accurate at the speeds NASA works with.</p>

So, Newton&#8217;s gravity equations will work just fine thanks.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Certainty is contextual. Suppose, in the context of our knowledge, the available evidence supports a theory. We should be certain about that theory. But what we are wrong? After all, we used to believe some strange things.</p>



<p>We used to think things burned because of phlogiston. Phlogiston was a mysterious substance that was thought to exist in all combustible bodies.</p>



<p>We used to think that dinosaurs were all sluggish, scaly critters that probably lived in swamps to support their massive weight.</p>



<p>Yes, sometimes we are wrong. Sometimes the facts do not support our theories. There are some theories that we have no business accepting as anything more than a plausible hypothesis.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="these-are-the-theories-that-do-not-make-up-the-body-of-settled-science-these-are-the-theories-we-should-not-consider-settled">These are the theories that do not make up the body of settled science. These are the theories we should not consider settled. </h3>


<p>It would be dishonest to consider a theory settled in the absence of evidence. It would also be dishonest to consider a theory settled if we did not understand it well enough to be sure it was consistent with all the available evidence.</p>



<p>Some theories are entirely reasonable within the context of the available evidence. Sometimes all the known evidence points to these theories being true. </p>



<p>Sometimes we understand the theory well enough to conclude it is entirely consistent with the facts. If the facts are consistent with that theory and only that theory, then we can be certain that the theory in question is true.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-should-not-entertain-serious-doubts-about-theories-that-have-substantial-evidence-behind-them">We should not entertain serious doubts about theories that have substantial evidence behind them. </h3>


<p>We can always <em>imagine</em> that we might disprove some theories. However, we should be certain about a theory if all the available evidence points to it being true.</p>



<p>Certainty does not require us to account for, by magic, for the possibility of a context of knowledge we do not currently possess. We can be certain that something is true even if there is something we do not know about now that may later show that it is not true.</p>



<p>Certainty is contextual, it is valid to be certain based on the context of available evidence. Provided that we are willing to address any evidence that arises, should the context of our knowledge change. We can be certain something is true. And yet adjust our theories when the context of our knowledge expands.</p>



<p>However, there are theories that we can consider completely and forever settled. These are theories we know with certainty and can prove with no shadow of a doubt to be true.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-know-these-facts-are-true-and-that-we-cannot-show-them-to-be-false">We know these facts are true and that we cannot show them to be false.</h3>


<p>It would contradict known facts of reality if they were not true. Things would have to not be what we know they are.</p>



<p>Examples of these would be that atoms exist. We know atoms exist; we have seen them. If they did not exist, almost everything we know about chemistry and atomic physics would not be true.</p>



<p>We know evolution happens. We might not know everything about how it happens, but we know it does. If I wanted disprove evolution, we would have to invalidate almost everything we know about biology and the known facts of biology would have to be other than what they are.</p>



<p>We know the Earth is round and that it orbits the Sun. To invalidate this, the direct evidence of our senses would have to be wrong! That we can see that the Earth is round would have to be fake. And how would we explain the observed behavior of Earth if it does not orbit the Sun? </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="450" height="450" src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-26164" srcset="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller.jpg 450w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FlatEarthSmaller-70x70.jpg 70w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It is much more scientific to think this might be real, right?</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We can say without a shadow of a doubt that theories like this are absolutely and forever settled and that we will never find anything that contradicts them. No such evidence is even <a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/the-possible-and-the-impossible/" data-type="post" data-id="35">possible</a>. </p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-completely-settled-such-science-it-would-be-nonsensical-to-pretend-otherwise">We completely settled such science. It would be nonsensical to pretend otherwise!</h3>


<p>So yes, there is such a thing as settled science. It is foolish to pretend otherwise. And it would be intellectually dishonest and non-scientific to pretend that we have not settled this!</p>



<p>It is unscientific to question that the Earth might not be round. Or that evolution does not happen. Or that atoms do not exist. Why? Because we have seen that the Earth is round! Are we to question the evidence of our senses so that we can become a Flattard?</p>



<p>It would contradict the obvious implications of the evidence of our senses to believe atoms do not exist. Additionally, we have seen atoms! It would go against observable facts and their logical implications to question that evolution happens.</p>



<p>It would be unscientific to question that light behaves like a wave. This would go against the evidence of our senses and the logical implications of that evidence.</p>



<p>To question theories we can show are irrefutable facts based on the evidence of our senses and the logical implications of such, is unscientific.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="your-belief-that-the-irrefutable-facts-of-reality-might-be-wrong-is-completely-nonsensical-and-unscientific">Your belief that the irrefutable facts of reality might be wrong is completely nonsensical and unscientific. </h3>


<p>The ability to entertain alternatives to the way reality works is not indicative of science. It is closer to the mindset of the religious person that must evade reality to maintain the possibility of his delusions. The questioning of everything, even things we can prove beyond any reasonable doubt, is little better than those that deny science outright. </p>



<p>To deny the absolute certainty of that which we can show beyond any reasonable doubt, is to either partially deny the veracity of the evidence or fail to understand that science is about the study of an objective reality, not blind guesswork.</p>
