Final pages will measure approximately 5x8 inches when folded, depending on your margin settings.

MIX and MATCH
You can mix and match the order of the pages. Print a journal page on one side of the paper or cardstock, flip and feed the paper through the printer to print another journal page on the other side.

⭐  Download and DIY Print – Please refer to how to print tips for more information on downloading and printing.
