This is episode nine of the Metaphysics of Physics podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Ashna, and I your host and guide through the hallowed halls of the philosophy of science. Thanks for tuning in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this show, we are fighting for a more rational world, mostly by looking through the lens of the philosophy of science. &nbsp;We raise awareness of issues within the philosophy of science and present alternative and rational approaches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find all the episodes, transcripts and subscription options on the website at rationalmetaphysician.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we have an interview with Juanma, physics and mathematics researcher, Objectivist and a fellow student of the philosophy of physics!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dwayne originally performed this interview. But, for various reasons we won\u2019t&nbsp;go into here, his segments were rerecorded by myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The audio may be of lower quality than normal. This is due to the fact that the interview was performed over Skype and the connection was of fairly low quality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, the audio should be of acceptable quality, but if parts are less clear there is a transcript which may help to clarify parts of the audio which might be difficult to make out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the transcript includes the answers Juanma prepared in advance and does not include extra commentary improvised during the interview.&nbsp; This extra content is nice, but it is not crucial. You should be able to get the gist of the answers provided to the questions from the transcript.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, without further ado, let us start the interview.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"interview\">Interview<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Juanma, please introduce yourself to our audience.<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>I am Juanma, my name is Jaun Manuel.&nbsp; I am a Spanish physicist and I majored in theoretical physics.&nbsp; And then I spent a year doing research in the foundation of quantum mechanics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I am living in London doing an MSc course in quite a different thing, which is the physics of complex systems.&nbsp; And I am also interested in philosophy and quantum mechanics interpretations.&nbsp; Which has been my motive even since I got into the science world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1) What did you study and why?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>In Madrid, I could have chosen mathematics or physics. In the end, I decided to major in physics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided this quite early during high school because the thing that most resonates with me is discovering and understanding natural phenomena.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I love mathematics, but I felt it was too far from the real world.&nbsp; So, in the end, I wanted something a little bit more hands-on, even if I have always been more inclined to the more fundamental and theoretical side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2) What are the right reasons to pursue an academic career in physics or other sciences? What will enable you to make it?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>Well, first of all, being quite the vocational career, so it takes a lot of dedication and interest. This is not a job that you can forget about once you get home, for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many scientists spend many more hours at work than they would normally have to, and some keep working even at home, even at night.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My supervisor, last year, was hoping for the family to go to sleep so he could keep doing research, after past, I don\u2019t know, midnight.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"320\" height=\"196\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/cat_naps.jpg\" alt=\"A kitty and some math papers.\" class=\"wp-image-26397\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/cat_naps.jpg 320w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/cat_naps-300x184.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">If you want to go into the sciences, learn to catnap so you can better handle those long hours.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>It takes so much dedication: it must be your passion, your job&nbsp;and your hobby.&nbsp; Which is quite of a thing to request for an interest in life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it just becomes your life.&nbsp; Everyone I have known who was taking a Ph.D. or just researching, have just turned science into their life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many jobs in this world, you can just forget about them once you are finished.&nbsp; But, science, particularly theoretical and fundamental sciences, you can to go bed and then come up with something, wake up (or stand up), take a note and then go back to bed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3) Alright, what are the things you did not like in academia?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>In the end, even if it seems to be quite a free enterprise, to decide what you are going to research, you actually depend on other people\u2019s approval just to thrive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t just do some research without telling your university, for example. Your university must approve of your research interests; your peers must accept your papers for publication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sometimes turns into compliance with the status quo, you know. And so some arbitrary ideas grow over time simply because it\u2019s not easy to get a voice if you disagree with the mainstream. Even if you present loads of compelling evidence, bring lots of information, sometimes the world of academia is quite reluctant to accept it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, in turn, compromises the quality of the science you produce. That is an inherent thing in academia, it has been ever since universities were built and began being a thing in the scientific literature world.&nbsp; So, I don\u2019t think there is much we can do about that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> What is&nbsp;it they say? Publish or perish? Well, they want you to publish stuff they think will bring in the funding. Which is fair, they obviously need the funding. But, less mainstream ideas might not be perceived as highly fundable ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4) What are the things you liked being in academia?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>Well, you rarely meet people that aren\u2019t passionate about their job, so everyone is pretty much up for discussion, time permitting, of course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can just go downstairs to the cafeteria and find some coffee and some interesting talk. For half an hour, one hour, about your research interests.&nbsp; So, you can share your passion with people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t usually find this in some other jobs. People are usually willing to forget about their jobs once they are done.&nbsp; But, in science, since it is such a vocational thing, you are always finding someone, some peers. I love that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, when you don\u2019t push reviewers\u2019 tolerance too much, you enjoy a lot of creative freedom and it rarely becomes monotonous.&nbsp; Because you can always job back and forth between different research topics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna<\/strong>: Yeah, even the most irrational of them, say, Max Tegmark, are very passionate. I dont like what he has to say, but he is passionate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5) Do you wish you had studied something different and if so, why?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>Thinking back, had I known how academic research would turn out, I would probably have gone for something I can still be creative at, but something that doesn\u2019t demand some gentle form of compliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also this Atlas Shrugged-related dilemma. I don\u2019t know if your audience is familiar with Atlas Shrugged plot, I won\u2019t disclose that much.&nbsp; But, this dilemma is basically that that scientists get scorned and underestimated, usually poorly paid and discredited. While for example, pseudoscience gets more and more popular because people nowadays prefer being told what they want to believe rather than the blatant truth.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/engineering.jpg\" alt=\"An engineer at work.\" class=\"wp-image-26399\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/engineering.jpg 400w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/engineering-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Engineering is  a more practical, hands on job than the theoretical sciences. You also are more likely to be paid for your overtime.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So that plays against science and for say, religious or pseudoscientific views.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\u2019s healthier for one\u2019s emotional wellbeing to pursue a career where you get what you earn. I sometimes think that becoming a researcher somehow resembles becoming a nun\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s implicitly written in the terms of your job that you will dedicate as much as it takes of yourself to science and that what you get from becomes pretty much irrelevant. You have decided to put your whole life, all your time, all that it takes, into science.&nbsp; And you are pretty much signing up for a contract where all your time, all your spare time, isn\u2019t that valuable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are about to publish some paper or if you are collaborating with someone, maybe you have to put in 18 hours. Well, that is a bit of an exaggeration, you have to put in a lot of hours into the day, perhaps sometimes skipping meals or coming home at past 10. It&#8217;s just a scientist\u2019s life. Nobody will see that, it is a strange thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you get some other job, you might get paid for extra hours. In science, it is implicitly accepted that you will have to do some extra hours at some point. But you just won\u2019t get paid for that. Simply because you are expected to be so committed to science that you are not expected to expect something else in return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would probably have gone for something which is more efficient in these terms. Where I can really get what I am working for and earn a decent amount to simply enjoy other aspects of life and not just let science absorb all of my time, all of my dedication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was about to move to naval engineering, which is something where I can see the results of my work in my hands, where I can touch the results of my work. Which I don\u2019t think is necessarily worse than doing science.&nbsp; But I also like to see where all of my work has got to. So, looking back, I might have chosen something of the sort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> Imagine how much better it would be if people lived in a world where we had greater respect for good science and more appreciation for how hard scientists work. I think they would be better off and might make more progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>6) What do you think about string theory?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>Ah well, to paraphrase The Fountainhead, \u201cI don\u2019t think of string theory\u201d. No, really, I think the methodology adopted by theoretical physicists in the last century inevitably leads to arbitrariness and, what\u2019s even worse, a complete disregard for understanding natural phenomena.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Descartes wrote several volumes rationalizing answers for every single scientific problem he could think of and then proceeded to proclaim that he had discovered everything. Literally, he said that. But at the very least he intended to understand the world around him.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"366\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Descartes.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Rene Descartes\" class=\"wp-image-26400\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Descartes.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Descartes-246x300.jpg 246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Descartes is, fairly, said to the be the father of modern philosophy. This is not a good thing.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Modern physicists make the exact same guesses, only mathematically more sophisticated, but they don\u2019t care about explaining reality. All that matters to them is to create a model, they say, that predicts numbers, and the less conceptual they get, the better; this is known as the \u201cshut up and compute\u201d principle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is, of course, a losing strategy for science, but they get their peers\u2019 appraisal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, however, mathematicians know that you can always make a model sophisticated enough to account for any data, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good model if you can\u2019t make any sense out of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, I could write down a set of equations explaining in detail when and how the light inside my fridge will turn on and off as I open and close the door, but have I actually learned anything about why it behaves so?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could claim that a ghost is operating the light, and my equations would not be able to contradict that because all they do is predict results rather than explain the facts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>String theory does exactly the same thing and that\u2019s why I consider that neither of those are even scientific in nature. They\u2019re more like mystical claims, epistemologically speaking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:&nbsp;<\/strong>I think the ghost theory might make more sense than string theory. Or, at least be easier to understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7) Who is your favorite figure in physics?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>Probably saying \u2018Newton\u2019 would be too uninteresting as we all know of his genius, and some of the audience will even be familiar with his work in the epistemological field of induction. So, to be a bit more of a romantic spirit, I will say \u2018Ludwig Boltzmann\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He vigorously fought for the relevance of philosophy in scientific activity, against the rising positivist current of his time, led by Ernst Mach. So, he was quite a hero in my view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He laid the foundation for, and then developed, statistical mechanics, which is the link between microscopic and macroscopic behaviour of physical systems. It is such an important core theory, because, for example, the existence of atoms could be proven in this way. So, this was actually the greatest feat in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century.&nbsp; So considered by all, nearly all, historians of science, because it was a causal explanation<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, in his time, causal explanations&nbsp;were severely disregarded, so the arrival of atomic theory as a proper, integrated explanation of microscopic was delayed because of the opposition to Boltzmann\u2019s views. But he defended it to the bone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, regardless of the outcome, he stood against a great philosophical danger<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> Boltzmann, he made my favorite list too, for basically the same reasons!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8) Least favorite figures?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>Now it\u2019d be a perfect moment to say \u2018Ernst Mach\u2019, but he wasn\u2019t even a scientist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Descartes was so thoroughly wrong it\u2019s funny to read him. It is so funny, I don\u2019t really hold any real antipathy against him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I\u2019d say modern physicists get the worst of me. And particularly Stephen Hawkins\u2019 figure has been remarkably damaging Fto the philosophy of science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He even claimed that philosophy was dead and science had to take over. He could get eloquently scornful with opposing views, to the delight of his followers, many of which, not versed in science, would absorb and spread this Neo-positivist viewpoint beyond the realm of science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think he was particularly damaging.&nbsp; And I think he was also quite overrated. If you look through his scientific feats, I think that the most important one was Hawking Radiation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I think he would be my least favorite figure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> Yeah, Feynman agreed on that, and so do a lot of physicists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Juanma:<\/strong> Yeah, it is a pity, right? Because Feynman was such a great guy. Maybe he had just absorbed too much of the philosophies of his time, he wasn&#8217;t that much to blame.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> Ernst Mach did not make my list, but only because he was not, as you point out, a scientist.&nbsp; But, he certainly deserves to make one of the lists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9) Which figures in physics and or math have been the most influential?<br><\/strong>The most influential have been those who have made a philosophical difference. There have been great mathematicians who have pushed their fields forward enormously: Gauss, Riemann, Euler\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But their mathematical feats aren\u2019t very influential: they are technical, foundational, deep and extremely useful, but I think being influential here is changing the way the whole subject is approached, for good or bad. In this, Newton and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cau<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">chy<\/a>, to mention some, have been really influential, have really made a difference.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"270\" height=\"343\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Cauchy.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Augustin Louis Cauchy.\" class=\"wp-image-26401\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Cauchy.jpg 270w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Cauchy-236x300.jpg 236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Portrait of Augustin Louis Cauchy.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Cauchy, for example, found a way of dealing with limits without ever appealing to the invalid concept of \u2018infinity\u2019. By that time engineers would rationalize the theory of limit taking by canceling infinities out and things like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cauchy found the way around this and thus laid the foundation not only for mathematical analysis, but also for the modern standard of mathematical rigor. S,o he really made a difference in the whole field of mathematics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for physics, and aside from Newton\u2026 Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr have been influential characters. Although promoters of unreason in science, each in his own&nbsp;way, the truth is that they paved the way for a change in the way scientists work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10) You have studied a lot of physics and done some research.&nbsp; Did you enjoy it? What did you like about it? What did you not like about it?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have much enjoyed the thrill of advancing humanity\u2019s knowledge, it seems quite a romantic attempt. I actually had a professor who would say that you can\u2019t get any nobler than that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it also gives you quite a lot of creative freedom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I did not like was that I found that my epistemological standards were mostly incompatible with how I was asked to validate my work. And this is not something related to simply being approved by people around you.&nbsp; But, you might not be allowed to do some of your work if you do not comply with their standards.&nbsp; Sometimes my standards were quite different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11) Do you get the impression that when it comes to certain parts of physics, there are a lot of floating abstractions which nobody understands?<\/strong><br><br>Absolutely, it even propagates back. Modern praxis is contaminating the teaching of classical concepts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Einstein said that you do not fully understand a physical concept unless you can describe it in such a way that your grandma can understand it. I think that was a very good way of looking at it.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-image-879 is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"315\" height=\"414\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Eiinstein.jpg\" alt=\"Einstein in front of blackboard.\" class=\"wp-image-26403\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Eiinstein.jpg 315w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Eiinstein-228x300.jpg 228w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Einstein spent much of his later life working on unified theories of physics of this type, to no avail.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Well, unfortunately, there\u2019s very little of this today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was Bohr who won that debate, so now the general trend is for lecturers to focus on the mathematical development of the theory, with extreme cases where you get scorned at for asking \u2018why\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is talking out of experience. I have seen a lecturer laughing at a classmate because she asked \u201cBut why is that the case? Why does that happen?\u201d.&nbsp; And he pointed at the blackboard and said: \u201cThat is the mathematical proof, that is the &#8216;why&#8217;. There is no &#8216;why&#8217; beyond that\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there a quite a lot of floating abstractions.&nbsp; For example, when classical studied thermodynamics, which is a well-established theory, which was established between the 17<sup>th<\/sup> and 19<sup>th<\/sup> centuries, I was presented it in an axiomatic way. Pretty much in the same way very abstract mathematics is presented and constructed today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we tried to deduce as much as we could from one axiom. And then once we couldn\u2019t deduce any other things or once we came up with questions we couldn\u2019t find an answer for in our set of axioms, we would add yet another one.&nbsp; And those axioms would eventually become the Laws of Thermodynamics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a really rationalistic way of presenting the theory and it is exactly the opposite way to which it was induced and discovered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the very same theory which was established in one way across many centuries can be flipped up and looked up from the opposite perceptive. And then what used to be so well established, sadly becomes a total floating abstraction and people really don\u2019t get a hold of the theory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, it even back propagates as I say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> I dont think too many grandmas would understand much of anything proposed today even if they had a postdoc&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Juanma:<\/strong> That is quite true. We could try it.

You decide to look into some aspect of reality and then you make experiments and then you try to integrate that with the full context of your knowledge. So, it is kind of doing things backward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, this [hypothetic-deductive] method has been used and as I say, it has been taught as<em> the<\/em> scientific method. They don\u2019t even make any mention of induction or any other way of understanding the real world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if that has been the chief scientific method and that has been what has brought all of the important results in the history of science. But, nowadays it is completely forgotten.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, the hypothetic-deductive has been the most influential, ideological aspect of modern physics today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what detaches the model from conceptual understanding. &nbsp;I think that is the most dangerous problem with this method.&nbsp; In my view, that is what lays the core of all this trend to forget about the physical meaning of the implication or causal relationships in the real world and to focus only on modeling and mathematical analysis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> Yeah, you can prove almost anything if you start with your conclusion and work backward from that. Isn&#8217;t that what religious people try to do all the time?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Juanma:<\/strong> Yeah, maybe they have learned it from religious&nbsp;theorists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>13) If you could do one thing to improve the state of modern physics, what would it be?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>I would teach philosophy and I would teach the importance of philosophy. That\u2019s all there is at the heart of this whole mess. And, more specifically, I would explain why induction is a valid methodology while hypothetic-deductive approaches are flawed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think if you can get that in the minds of modern want-to-be scientists, then the whole of the world of academia and the world of scientific research will improve significantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will basically get much better scientists when they know why they are doing it and why it is valid that they reason in one specific way and not some other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> A lesson badly needed, given how dismissive many in the field are of philosophy. I dont think there are a lot of great inductive thinkers in the field or in any field for that matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Juanma: <\/strong>Other than teaching philosophy and letting it spread and gain influence all the time, I can really see nothing that can be done to improve scientific research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most researchers are far too stubborn to change their minds now and it is a saying among physicists that if you want a clever idea to spread out and become popular, you should first wait for the current generation of physicists to just retire or die before the new idea can really shine out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is actually a really sad thing, but it is systematic of a really widespread problem in academia that some new ideas get rejected too quickly. When actually, science should be ready to accept reasonable proposals and new viewpoints.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> Yeap, they better start training the next generation of physicists in philosophy. They should put it in high school, certainly first-year college classes. Since it is at least as important as physics classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>14) Do you think modern physics can be saved? If so, how?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>Oh, I do think it can be saved. After all, the mathematics is well crafted. All it takes is scientists who devote more time to understanding what can already be described instead of elaborating further in the mathematical sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may seem a utopia, but actually, mathematicians do that. They recognize the value in understanding stuff as much as moving forward. It is a cultural, or rather sub-cultural, thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Physicists tend to be much less interested in this and this is reflected in the \u201cdemand\u201d for such advancing work. For deducing new things from what has already been deduced rather than actually giving a better intuition or understanding of what has already been discovered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna<\/strong>: That sounds quite achievable, given the right cultural changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>15) Do you get the impression that physicists understand what mathematics is why it is so useful?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>No, they don\u2019t. No, I don\u2019t think they do. But fortunately, mathematics is too solid to be affected by their users\u2019 misconceptions, most of the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many physicists like to say that mathematics is the language of the universe as if natural phenomena were somehow written in a code. Quite close to a divine creator viewpoint, it seems to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find it quite simple: we create mathematical concepts, and then theorems and theories based on those concepts are discovered as necessary implications of the definitions that we created.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may be taking a long shot here, but I think they don\u2019t realize that we create mathematical concepts because they have given up on induction, so they only focus on the deductive part. Which is a sad thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> I think the Republic represents a fairly accurate view of what many consider mathematics to be.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"392\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/PlatoAndAristotle.jpg\" alt=\"Plato and Aristotle walking.\" class=\"wp-image-26405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/PlatoAndAristotle.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/PlatoAndAristotle-230x300.jpg 230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Time for the usual picture of Plato.

Isn\u2019t a compendium of all human knowledge by definition an attempt at a theory of everything? I don\u2019t quite get the definition they give.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do they want to unify forces and particles? How is that supposed to be a theory of everything? Good luck using that theory to explain phase transitions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then why do they call it \u201cof everything\u201d? I think it is of everything they deem worthy of such a godlike theory?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being more realistic and also more ambitious, wouldn\u2019t something like conservation of energy be a much, much better candidate for a theory of literally everything?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think that they are lost in their quest for grandeur. You know what I mean? I don\u2019t think it is, ultimately, about understanding the world or getting a unified description of it. It is mostly about feeling as though they have ascended into a godly realm or something like that. That they have crowned human knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think they are looking for something of a personal glory. Which I think is OK, but it is not in finding such an apparent \u201cTheory of Everything\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human knowledge, by definition, is the theory of everything. As we get going, it just advances forward and forward. And since everything is integrated, that is a \u201cTheory of Everything\u201d. Anything else is just pretense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> I think they basically want to be able to describe everything in physics in a set of equations you can print on a t-shirt.&nbsp; I have heard some of them say this<strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Juanma: <\/strong>If you want a short equation to describe everything in physics, you could just write, &#8220;E dot equals zero&#8221;.&nbsp; I mean, that is something that you can print on a t-shirt. That&#8217;s not something most people will really understand.&nbsp; So, it is not so easily solved.&nbsp; But, being honest, I think that is the closest you will ever get to a &#8220;Theory of Everything&#8221;, just saying that energy gets conserved over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think emergent properties prove that no such monastic Theory of Everything will ever be achievable. Because at different levels, the very same physical objects behave or give way to very different results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you can&#8217;t just encode macroscopic behaviors and microscopic behaviors in a table of fundamental particles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any attempt at what they call a &#8220;Theory of Everything&#8221; is not really a &#8220;Theory of Everything&#8221;.&nbsp; It is just a theory of everything they care about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>17) There are, of course, other interpretations of quantum physics than the Copenhagen one. To what extent are they taken seriously?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, generally speaking, fundamental physicists can be divided into two big groups, aside from sparse exceptions.&nbsp;On the one hand we have neo-Positivists, who disregard anything that contains the words \u201cexplanation\u201d, \u201cinterpretation\u201d, \u201cphysical meaning\u201d or anything of the sort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, there are mystics who enjoy pretending that science-fiction is actually real. These, interestingly, only take seriously whatever is deranged, and disregard any serious attempt at explaining things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They get really picky when you try to say electrons have a physically determinate position, but they are totally okay with it, somehow crossing two slits at the same time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s just going by emotion: instead of considering facts, they stick to whatever picture seems more appealing to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna<\/strong>: I imagine of Bohr was alive, he would tell us to try blend all these approaches together somehow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>18) Tell us about some of the most troublesome trends you have encountered in your studies and\/or research?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have really struggled with the \u2018shut up and compute\u2019 paradigm, because I simply cannot work like that: if I don\u2019t fully understand what I\u2019m doing, I get blocked, because my mind is unable to focus on anything other than understanding it. I can\u2019t go on if I don\u2019t get a sense, at least a sense, of what I\u2019m doing, and when nobody provides such conceptual explanations, I\u2019m in serious trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/headache.jpg\" alt=\"Man with headache clutching head.\" class=\"wp-image-26406\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/headache.jpg 320w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/headache-300x300.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/headache-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/headache-70x70.jpg 70w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Here is what the Shut Up and Compute paradigm does for me &#8230;<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>On a more technical level, there\u2019s one huge mistake that pops up everywhere in physics education. Many absorb it inadvertently, but it\u2019s quite harmful. Some people implicitly think in terms of Aristotle\u2019s \u201cfinal causes\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is, reality acts in some way <em>so that<\/em> something else happens or remains true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, many people will state that \u201cthe system evolves in order to reach the state of minimum energy\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will also say that \u201celectric charges move around a conductor so that the field inside is zero\u201d. Or that \u201csome random events will happen to compensate some others in probability\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, to them, the laws of the universe, perhaps \u201cwritten in mathematical language\u201d in some mystical way, are literally obeyed by reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes they\u2019re quite literal about this, stating that \u201cthe equation must hold, so this must happen\u201d. This is a blatant reversal of the cause and the effect principle, or premises and implications for that matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that is a total misunderstanding of causality, and people who get used to thinking that way usually lose their ability to think causally. And many people do that, let me tell you, many people do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> My brain works that way.&nbsp; If I am reading something and I cannot understand it my brain freezes and says &#8220;you are not going on until you figure out what that was all about&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, sometimes I know it there is not much to understand, because is not explained, so I just have to move on.<br><br><strong>19)Tell us about some of your better experiences in your studies and or research. Is there anything that gives you hope?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>Well, not to brag about it, but most of my best experiences during my studies starred me. I would be a rebel, which felt liberating but it also brought up some trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<p>I remember once that I was in a lab, measuring the viscosity of a liquid by taking measurements on the speed of metal balls falling through a tube filled with the liquid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The equation to describe this assumed the ball was falling in a big pool of liquid, away from the walls of the container, and this wasn\u2019t the case, of course, since it was a rather fine tube.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To account for that, a correction had to be made. It was a multiplicative factor, and my lab tutors were insisting that we made a correction to the experimental data so that they matched the model\u2019s prediction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mathematically, that is equivalent to multiplying the model\u2019s prediction by the inverse of that factor, so why on Earth would you \u201ccorrect the facts\u201d to fit the model instead of correcting the model to fit the facts?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, they insisted thoroughly. At least they could have told me it was all the same and they didn\u2019t care, but they didn\u2019t. They insisted that I corrected the data. And I did not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I corrected the model.  And I think they gave me a lower grade for that, and I happily accepted it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\u2019s not very hopeful if there\u2019s only one person appearing in good experiences, so here\u2019s another one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enrolled in History of Physics, which sounds like a sensible and interesting thing to do, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the lecturer hadn\u2019t realized that knowing history does not guarantee that you know philosophy, so she messed up saying that Newton brought Rationalism into physic. Which is, wow, a horrible thing to say. I think she meant to say that he intended to use reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, she once asked a loaded question, assuming that determinism in physics (the idea that nature acts in specific ways and never causelessly) somehow implied that there was no free will.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was looking through the window, listening to my classmates jabbering one after the other. It was a damn horrible show. And then, among those incongruent rationalizations and pointless mumbo-jumbo, a girl challenged the lecturer\u2019s premise implicit in the question. I quickly turned my head to find that heroine of the moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was pretty much the end of it, nothing followed from there, but it was good to see someone able to question the premises thrown at her instead of playing logical chess with unchecked premises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is yet another story: I took part in a debate where a group of students antagonizing modern quantum mechanics tried to spread out some interesting results that have been coming up in recent years. Most of the audience still favored quantum woo, but some people were impressed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple years ago a classical system was set up in a completely analogous way as that of a quantum particle in a confined region, and the results matched perfectly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think people are slowly discovering that there is so much more classical physics to quantum physics than modern physicists would like to accept.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-image-888 is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"350\" height=\"469\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Aristotle_Bust.jpg\" alt=\"Marble bust of Aristotle.\" class=\"wp-image-26409\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Aristotle_Bust.jpg 350w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Aristotle_Bust-224x300.jpg 224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Not many man can lay claim to making the modern world possible.

And are so deemed as random processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot of theory around these systems which resembles or matches Schrodinger&#8217;s Equation and wave functions.&nbsp; So, there is a lot to be understood of the probabilities in quantum physics by means of these probabilities which can describe any sort of event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the probability of extinction for a particular species in an ecosystem.&nbsp; Which is not only a classical concept but even a non-physical one, because it is about animals eating each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, apparently, this theory has brought up a lot of interesting ideas that may extend the realm in which Schrodinger&#8217;s Equation was originally conceived.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure, but maybe this has advanced attempts to find classical correspondence to quantum concepts. And they have been quite successful thus far.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> I guess it helps that a lot of physicists are cruising on philosophical inertia. They dont really care that much about the philosophies that they are applying. There is no real passion or interest in the philosophy. So, to some extent, they can absorb a few better ideas here and there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t understand the philosophies they are applying<strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Juanma: <\/strong>And they will even think the philosophies are irrelevant, while they are actually using it implicitly.&nbsp; So, that makes them even more clueless.

Math or physics?<\/strong><br><strong><br><\/strong>Huh, this is an easy question. Mathematics is way, way more rational. Mathematicians keep a healthy sense of curiosity and they care about ideas and conceptual understanding beyond symbols. Physicists, as you just said, are much more careless about that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a paradigmatic example of this is the infamous statement that the sum of all positive integers somehow gives minus one over twelve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s mostly physicists that enjoy dazzling their audience with this (and that should ring a bell if you remember how they favor nonsensical interpretations in quantum mechanics just because they look mysterious).<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-image-891 size-full is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"350\" height=\"369\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/olderNewton.jpg\" alt=\"Older Isaac Newton.\" class=\"wp-image-26410\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/olderNewton.jpg 350w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/olderNewton-285x300.jpg 285w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Here is an older Newton.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Instead, a proper mathematician, and I say proper, will hack this confusion into pieces by stating the simple truth, which is the job of a proper mathematician, by the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens in this particular case, is that the function which gives that value cannot be associated with an infinite sum in that case because that infinite sum representation of the function is valid for arguments strictly greater than positive one, actually, real numbers, and the argument giving minus one over twelve is negative one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this infinite series representation does not apply to that argument. But, physicists prefer not to say anything about that, they conveniently omit it because it somehow spoils the fun, I think. So then they can keep the magic alive that somehow such an apparent contradiction could hold in the real world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashna:<\/strong> If I remember correctly, that silly equation you mentioned originally came up in the context of string theory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Juanma:<\/strong> Yeah, it is true.
