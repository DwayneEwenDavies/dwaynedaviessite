<p>This is a republishing of the Metaphysics of Physics podcast interview with the Spanish physicist Juanma. We talk about physics, the role of philosophy in physics and what can be done to improve the state of modern physics. You can find more of our interviews <a href="http://localhost/rational/interviews/" data-type="page" data-id="686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>For those unaware, the Metaphysics of Physics was the previous incarnation of this site and for a time in included a podcast.</p>



<p>You can read the transcript below or use the audio player below to listen to the interview. Or do both if you prefer!\</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>[Please note that this may not exactly match the audio. However, there should be no significant differences.&nbsp; Also, note that the audio may of poorer quality than previous episodes, so you might want to keep this in mind.]</p>



<p>Hi everyone! This is episode nine of the Metaphysics of Physics podcast.</p>



<p>I am Ashna, and I your host and guide through the hallowed halls of the philosophy of science. Thanks for tuning in!</p>



<p>With this show, we are fighting for a more rational world, mostly by looking through the lens of the philosophy of science. &nbsp;We raise awareness of issues within the philosophy of science and present alternative and rational approaches.</p>



<p>You can find all the episodes, transcripts and subscription options on the website at rationalmetaphysician.com.</p>



<p>Today we have an interview with Juanma, physics and mathematics researcher, Objectivist and a fellow student of the philosophy of physics!</p>



<p>Dwayne originally performed this interview. But, for various reasons we won’t&nbsp;go into here, his segments were rerecorded by myself.</p>



<p>The audio may be of lower quality than normal. This is due to the fact that the interview was performed over Skype and the connection was of fairly low quality.</p>



<p>For the most part, the audio should be of acceptable quality, but if parts are less clear there is a transcript which may help to clarify parts of the audio which might be difficult to make out.</p>



<p>Note that the transcript includes the answers Juanma prepared in advance and does not include extra commentary improvised during the interview.&nbsp; This extra content is nice, but it is not crucial. You should be able to get the gist of the answers provided to the questions from the transcript.</p>



<p>But, without further ado, let us start the interview.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="interview">Interview</h2>


<p><strong>Juanma, please introduce yourself to our audience.</strong><br><strong><br></strong>I am Juanma, my name is Jaun Manuel.&nbsp; I am a Spanish physicist and I majored in theoretical physics.&nbsp; And then I spent a year doing research in the foundation of quantum mechanics.</p>



<p>Now I am living in London doing an MSc course in quite a different thing, which is the physics of complex systems.&nbsp; And I am also interested in philosophy and quantum mechanics interpretations.&nbsp; Which has been my motive even since I got into the science world.</p>



<p><strong>1) What did you study and why?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>In Madrid, I could have chosen mathematics or physics. In the end, I decided to major in physics.</p>



<p>I decided this quite early during high school because the thing that most resonates with me is discovering and understanding natural phenomena.</p>



<p>I mean, I love mathematics, but I felt it was too far from the real world.&nbsp; So, in the end, I wanted something a little bit more hands-on, even if I have always been more inclined to the more fundamental and theoretical side.</p>



<p><strong>2) What are the right reasons to pursue an academic career in physics or other sciences? What will enable you to make it?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Well, first of all, being quite the vocational career, so it takes a lot of dedication and interest. This is not a job that you can forget about once you get home, for example.</p>



<p>Many scientists spend many more hours at work than they would normally have to, and some keep working even at home, even at night.</p>



<p>My supervisor, last year, was hoping for the family to go to sleep so he could keep doing research, after past, I don’t know, midnight.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="320" height="196" src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat_naps.jpg" alt="A kitty and some math papers." class="wp-image-26397" srcset="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat_naps.jpg 320w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat_naps-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">If you want to go into the sciences, learn to catnap so you can better handle those long hours.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It takes so much dedication: it must be your passion, your job&nbsp;and your hobby.&nbsp; Which is quite of a thing to request for an interest in life.</p>



<p>Yeah, it just becomes your life.&nbsp; Everyone I have known who was taking a Ph.D. or just researching, have just turned science into their life.</p>



<p>Many jobs in this world, you can just forget about them once you are finished.&nbsp; But, science, particularly theoretical and fundamental sciences, you can to go bed and then come up with something, wake up (or stand up), take a note and then go back to bed.</p>



<p><strong>3) Alright, what are the things you did not like in academia?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>In the end, even if it seems to be quite a free enterprise, to decide what you are going to research, you actually depend on other people’s approval just to thrive.</p>



<p>You can’t just do some research without telling your university, for example. Your university must approve of your research interests; your peers must accept your papers for publication.</p>



<p>This sometimes turns into compliance with the status quo, you know. And so some arbitrary ideas grow over time simply because it’s not easy to get a voice if you disagree with the mainstream. Even if you present loads of compelling evidence, bring lots of information, sometimes the world of academia is quite reluctant to accept it.</p>



<p>This, in turn, compromises the quality of the science you produce. That is an inherent thing in academia, it has been ever since universities were built and began being a thing in the scientific literature world.&nbsp; So, I don’t think there is much we can do about that.</p>



<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> What is&nbsp;it they say? Publish or perish? Well, they want you to publish stuff they think will bring in the funding. Which is fair, they obviously need the funding. But, less mainstream ideas might not be perceived as highly fundable ideas.</p>



<p><strong>4) What are the things you liked being in academia?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Well, you rarely meet people that aren’t passionate about their job, so everyone is pretty much up for discussion, time permitting, of course.</p>



<p>You can just go downstairs to the cafeteria and find some coffee and some interesting talk. For half an hour, one hour, about your research interests.&nbsp; So, you can share your passion with people.</p>



<p>You don’t usually find this in some other jobs. People are usually willing to forget about their jobs once they are done.&nbsp; But, in science, since it is such a vocational thing, you are always finding someone, some peers. I love that.</p>



<p>Also, when you don’t push reviewers’ tolerance too much, you enjoy a lot of creative freedom and it rarely becomes monotonous.&nbsp; Because you can always job back and forth between different research topics.</p>



<p><strong>Ashna</strong>: Yeah, even the most irrational of them, say, Max Tegmark, are very passionate. I dont like what he has to say, but he is passionate.</p>



<p><strong>5) Do you wish you had studied something different and if so, why?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Thinking back, had I known how academic research would turn out, I would probably have gone for something I can still be creative at, but something that doesn’t demand some gentle form of compliance.</p>



<p>There is also this Atlas Shrugged-related dilemma. I don’t know if your audience is familiar with Atlas Shrugged plot, I won’t disclose that much.&nbsp; But, this dilemma is basically that that scientists get scorned and underestimated, usually poorly paid and discredited. While for example, pseudoscience gets more and more popular because people nowadays prefer being told what they want to believe rather than the blatant truth.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="400" height="266" src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/engineering.jpg" alt="An engineer at work." class="wp-image-26399" srcset="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/engineering.jpg 400w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/engineering-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Engineering is  a more practical, hands on job than the theoretical sciences. You also are more likely to be paid for your overtime.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>So that plays against science and for say, religious or pseudoscientific views.</p>



<p>I think it’s healthier for one’s emotional wellbeing to pursue a career where you get what you earn. I sometimes think that becoming a researcher somehow resembles becoming a nun…</p>



<p>It’s implicitly written in the terms of your job that you will dedicate as much as it takes of yourself to science and that what you get from becomes pretty much irrelevant. You have decided to put your whole life, all your time, all that it takes, into science.&nbsp; And you are pretty much signing up for a contract where all your time, all your spare time, isn’t that valuable.</p>



<p>If you are about to publish some paper or if you are collaborating with someone, maybe you have to put in 18 hours. Well, that is a bit of an exaggeration, you have to put in a lot of hours into the day, perhaps sometimes skipping meals or coming home at past 10. It&#8217;s just a scientist’s life. Nobody will see that, it is a strange thing.</p>



<p>If you get some other job, you might get paid for extra hours. In science, it is implicitly accepted that you will have to do some extra hours at some point. But you just won’t get paid for that. Simply because you are expected to be so committed to science that you are not expected to expect something else in return.</p>



<p>I would probably have gone for something which is more efficient in these terms. Where I can really get what I am working for and earn a decent amount to simply enjoy other aspects of life and not just let science absorb all of my time, all of my dedication.</p>



<p>I was about to move to naval engineering, which is something where I can see the results of my work in my hands, where I can touch the results of my work. Which I don’t think is necessarily worse than doing science.&nbsp; But I also like to see where all of my work has got to. So, looking back, I might have chosen something of the sort.</p>



<p><strong>Ashna:</strong> Imagine how much better it would be if people lived in a world where we had greater respect for good science and more appreciation for how hard scientists work. I think they would be better off and might make more progress.</p>



<p><br><strong>6) What do you think about string theory?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Ah well, to paraphrase The Fountainhead, “I don’t think of string theory”. No, really, I think the methodology adopted by theoretical physicists in the last century inevitably leads to arbitrariness and, what’s even worse, a complete disregard for understanding natural phenomena.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>Today we have an interview with Warren Fahy, author of the books Fragment and Pandemonium. We are going to talk about these books as well as about some biology stuff. Should be fun!</p>



<p>Some of you may not know what these books are. Well, Warren is going to tell us all about them in a little bit. But they are science thrillers something along the lines of Jurassic Park.</p>



<p>You can probably gather by the fact that I am interviewing him about these books, that I have read them and probably enjoy them.</p>



<p>Yes, I have read them and I do enjoy them. Fragment and the sequel are amazingly interesting books with some extremely compelling biological theories.</p>



<p>There are some truly terrifying, nightmare creatures in both of them. They make the dinosaurs and monsters in other books seem tame. Dragons? T-Rexes? The critters in these books, such as spigers are much deadlier and scarier.</p>

<p>I also quite like the main cast of characters, but I cannot talk about that very much without spoilers. But two of them are biologists and they may or may not have some fascinating biological ideas, new and old.</p>



<p>Highly recommended. But more than that and as entertaining as the scary monsters are, you might also learn something reading this.</p>



<p>If you have not read these books, you might want to go to the <a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/fragment-pandemonium-interview-nospoiler/" data-type="post" data-id="639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-spoiler version</a> of the podcast here.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="brief-excerpt">Brief Excerpt</h2>


<p><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Hello, welcome to episode twenty-five of the Metaphysics of Physics podcast.<br><br>I am Dwayne Davies, your occasional host. Today we are going to interview Warren Fahy, the author of the bestselling books Fragment and Pandemonium.<br><br>Some of you may not know what these books are. Well, Warren is going to tell us all about them in a little bit. But they are science thriller something along the lines of Jurassic Park.<br><br>You can probably gather by the fact that I am interviewing him about these books, that I have read them and probably enjoy them. Yes, I have read them and I do enjoy them.<br><br>Fragment and the sequel are amazingly interesting books with some extremely compelling biological theories.</p>



<p>There are some truly terrifying, nightmare creatures in both of them. They make the dinosaurs and monsters in other books seem tame. Dragons? T-Rexes? The critters in these books, such as spigers are<br>much deadlier and scarier.<br><br>I also quite like the main cast of characters, but I cannot talk about that very much without spoilers. But two of them are biologists and they may or may not have some fascinating biological ideas, new and old.<br><br>Highly recommended. But more than that and as entertaining as the scary monsters are, you might also learn something reading this.<br><br>All right, now we have that out of the way, lets get back into things.</p>



<p>Alright, thank you for being here Warren.<br><br>Give us a brief introduction to Fragment and Pandemonium. Later questions will focus more on the science and the like, so maybe, for now, focus more on the theme and the plots.<br><br><strong>Warren:</strong> Perfect. Well, Fragment and Pandemonium are science thrillers. They are somewhat in the vein of Michael Crichton books,which happened to be my favorite kind of thriller.<br><br>I like to read a thriller, get something out of it, get some new information and to learn something. So that was the kind of book I decided I wanted to write.</p>



<p>Since I was a kid, I&#8217;ve been writing. And I have been studying evolution since I dug a fossil out of the hills behind my grandparent’s home when I was eight. And ever since then I&#8217;ve been fascinated by evolution. So, I decided to mine that avenue for a thriller.<br><br>I hadn&#8217;t really seen anyone ever deal with the concept of a completely separate evolution that was isolated and went off in a completely different direction. Resulting in an entire ecosystem of almost alien creatures. If you went back far enough, I figured you could make a very compelling world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is a republishing of the Metaphysics of Physics podcast interview with physicist Bill Gaede, originator of the Rope Hypothesis. We talk about the Rope Hypothesis and some of the problems he has with modern physics.</p>



<p>For those unaware, the Metaphysics of Physics was the previous incarnation of this site and for a time in included a podcast.</p>



<p>You can read the transcript or use the audio player below to listen to the interview. Or do both if you prefer!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>Today we have an interview with the physicist Bill Gaede, originator of the Rope Hypothesis. We have not presented the transcript of this in web page form. Instead, you can listen to the audio or download the PDF transcript.</p>



<p>You can find out more about Bill Gaede&#8217;s idea on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5kqQKUWqsNum3WtLhHN5yw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube page</a>. Check out his <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Bill-Gaede" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quora profile</a> to see him answering some physics questions.</p>



<p>You may have problems with the audio if you hit the play button above after jumping part of the way into the audio. We are not sure what this issue is or how to fix it. You can download the episode or simply play it from the beginning.</p>



<p>Gaede and I discuss the problems in modern physics, some of the many ways in which physics is irrational, the improper conflation of mathematics with physics, his rope model and more.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="500" height="517" src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Gaede.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-26482" srcset="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Gaede.jpg 500w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Gaede-290x300.jpg 290w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bill Gaede demonstrating his rope model.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The problems he mentions are largely centered around the idea that we do not have physicists anymore, we have mathematicians. People that try to describe but not explain how this universe works. But, physics is meant to be about explaining how the universe works!</p>



<p>This is where the rope model comes in. It offers an explanation of light, electromagnetism, gravity and more. Gaede discusses this in some depth in his book &#8220;Why God Does Not Exist&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Dwayne: </strong>Okay, we&#8217;ll start with the first and most obvious question, what is physics? You have talked about the Golden Principle of physics. Tell us about that as well.<br><br><strong>Gaede:</strong> Yeah, well, the Golden Principle.<br><br>First, physics is not the study of this or the study of that. Anybody can study and not be able to explain anything in science, let alone physics. But science is not just the study of something. It&#8217;s explaining something, especially as regards to physics. You must explain physical mechanisms, causes. That&#8217;s what I think physics is about.<br><br>In order to explain causes, you need to have objects. And I think the bread and butter of physics is this word called object. And to me, it&#8217;s stunning that no one has figured this out in mathematical physics.<br><br>Since the days of Newton, at least, no one has figured out that you need an object to do physics. Once you cover that stuff, you got to define the word object. And no one has defined the word object in a scientific way.<br><br>Not a single physics textbook on planet Earth begins by saying: “This is an object and this is what we&#8217;re going to do with it”.<br><br>In other words, specifically defined keywords that you need for the foundations of physics. This is an object, this is distance, this is a location. This is what we mean by motion. These words have never been defined in a scientific way.<br><br>In fact, Newton said he didn&#8217;t know what motion was. And so, yes, I think physics is the study of causes and mechanism. It&#8217;s not about math, it&#8217;s not about measuring and it&#8217;s not about equations.<br><br>It&#8217;s about explaining a mechanism. You want to explain how a magnet works; you want to explain how gravity works.<br><br>In order to do that, you need objects and you need to define what an object is. So, in a nutshell, is my vision of physics.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Okay, so how would you define an object?<br><br><strong>Gaede:</strong> Well, you know, if you look in the dictionary, you&#8217;ll find definitions of ordinary speech, not scientific definitions. In other words, not ones that you can use consistently, rationally.In order to use that word consistently, scientifically, rationally, you have to define it as that which has shape. That&#8217;s the only property all objects have, whether imaginary objects or real objects. All of them have the<br>same property, shape.<br><br>And what doesn&#8217;t have shape as known as a concept, essentially.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>Right, I agree. What is mathematics? And how does it relate to physical objects? For instance, how do numbers relate to physical objects?<br><br><strong>Gaede:</strong> I love the question. No, I&#8217;m saying mathematics has nothing to do with physics or with science. And people immediately say: “Why? No, you&#8217;re crazy. What do you mean, mathematics has nothing to do with science?”<br><br>We go back to the definitions and just follow them strictly. What is science about? What is physics about? Physics is about explaining phenomena, causes and mechanisms. We have no use for mathematics whatsoever.<br><br>So, in that sense, mathematics has absolutely nothing to do with physics or with science. If physics is about explaining causes and mechanisms<br><br>Obviously, if you define physics as measurement, equations, predictions, observation, proof evidence, well, then yeah, then you can bring mathematics in.<br><br>What&#8217;s happened is that the mathematicians have defined what science, what physics is, not the physicists. And a real genuine physicist defines physics a little differently than a mathematician. He views it as causes and mechanisms. For that, we have no use whatsoever for mathematics.<br><br>What does an equation do? Equations are just a description. And I&#8217;m not asking for a description. I&#8217;m asking for an explanation.<br><br>And for that, you need to define the words “explain” and “describe” and find out what the difference between those two words is. But a lot of people think they&#8217;re synonyms.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>Okay, so how would you describe these words and the difference between them?<br><br><strong>Gaede:</strong> Well, a description is a listing of properties. Say that I want to describe a chair. I say it&#8217;s got four legs, it&#8217;s brown, it&#8217;s big, it&#8217;s small. I use adjectives and I qualify it. All I&#8217;m doing is describing. I haven&#8217;t explained anything so far.<br><br>An explanation is revealing causes and mechanisms for phenomena. And saying that there was something which happened. You are going to say how it happened.<br><br>Meaning, not a description like “It fell down and it fell at 9.8 meters per second squared”.<br><br>No, that&#8217;s not an explanation. You want to know what caused it to fall down and not up, for example. Or how does one magnet attract another?<br><br>I can&#8217;t just say, well, it attracts at such and such speed at such and such distance. That&#8217;s not an explanation. That&#8217;s just the description.<br><br>What I want is an experience. I want to know the mechanism. If I want to explain to you the mechanism, then I can use the following example, because I guess everybody can relate to it.<br><br>You have a pulley and you have a bucket. You have a rope tied to the bucket and the rope goes around the pulley, the little wheel. And you say well, how did he put the bucket up there? It was full of water, and how do you put the butter bucket up there?<br><br>I show the movie and I don&#8217;t even have to explain anything. I can just show the movie. All the objects are all visible. And you see this guy pulls on the rope, the rope goes around the pulley, the wheel turns and the bucket goes up.<br><br>So, everybody looks at that and they say, I understand how the bucket ended up there, he just pulled down on the rope.<br><br>And that is a mechanism everybody can understand. Because everything is visible in front of your very own eyes. And so, all you have to do is watch the movie and say, “I understand the mechanism”.<br><br>But we don&#8217;t do that with magnets. We don&#8217;t do that with gravity, we don&#8217;t do that with light or with atomic behavior. We don&#8217;t do that with electricity.<br><br>What we say there oh, let me describe it for you. And in the case of gravity, they say mass. And mass is a concept, it is a mathematical concept. I can&#8217;t say mass did this or mass did that. It is like saying the weight of an elephant did this. The weight of an elephant squashed the ant.<br><br>No, it was the foot of the elephant that squashed the ant, not the weight. Weight has no power to do anything. Weight is a mathematical concept.<br><br>Likewise, mass is a mathematical concept. And you can&#8217;t say energy did this or that either, because that&#8217;s another mathematical concept.<br><br>The problem we have today is that we use these words like field, force and time. But nobody has defined these terms, which are obvious concepts.<br><br>And they use them as if they were physical objects. They tell you that time has warped. And they tell you that they sent energy, that they transferred energy. They say that they moved the mass. That the force<br>was strong, it was a very strong force. And so forth.<br><br>And so, we&#8217;re using all these concepts as physical objects. We have gotten so used to it because they&#8217;re all mathematical concepts. And its mathematicians who have defined science, not physicists.<br><br>In fact, if you go back to square one, we go back to Aristotle, he&#8217;s the guy who wrote the first book of physics that we have today. The first extant book of physics. That&#8217;s his eponymous book known as “Physics”.</p>



<p>Aristotle says, look, mathematicians do angles, numbers, that&#8217;s mathematicians. Physicists, they do causes.<br><br>And a lot of people criticize this and they say “Well, Bill, you want to go back to the days of Aristotle”.<br><br>But you must understand the context. The context is not that we want to go back to Aristotle in the sense that maybe his scientific method was to be desired. The issue is that he had the right idea, physics explains causes. That&#8217;s what we forgot.<br><br>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with people doing experiments. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with people doing math if they want. But when they come to the conference, they have to explain the mechanism. And that&#8217;s what they forgot about.<br><br>They do a lot of math, they have a lot of descriptions, equations, numbers., they talk about infinity. They bring in all these fancy words like energy and field. And what we&#8217;re missing is the explanation of the mechanism.We still don&#8217;t know how one magnet attracts another. Or how gravity works. And this is the issue.<br><br>That&#8217;s why I go back to Aristotle only in the context of that business about causes and mechanisms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is an interview with the Objectivist computer scientist Martin Johansen.  We discussed his lecture &#8220;Charles Babbage: Induction in Computer Science&#8221;. You can and should purchase a copy of <a href="https://estore.aynrand.org/products/charles-babbage-induction-in-computer-science-mp3-download?_pos=1&amp;_sid=74692a7ab&amp;_ss=r" data-type="URL" data-id="https://estore.aynrand.org/products/charles-babbage-induction-in-computer-science-mp3-download?_pos=1&amp;_sid=74692a7ab&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this lecture here</a>.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-introduction">Introduction </h2>


<p>This is a great introduction to the role of induction in science in general, not just computer science. Although, of course, we covered a lot of computer science topics as well. </p>



<p>You should find this instructive and interesting even if you are not an expert on computer science or philosophy. Martin explains very clearly what induction is, why it is important and how it can be used in computer science and other fields. </p>



<p>We also discussed some of why it is dismissed today. As well as the irrational way modern academics such as Turing approach the field of computer science.<br><br>Here is the list of questions I prepared when asking him. I did not go very far off script. It gives you a pretty good idea of what we discussed. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="questions-on-computer-science">Questions on Computer Science</h2>


<p>What is your background in computer science and philosophy?</p>



<p>What is a computer and what is the origin of this this term?</p>



<p>Why did you choose to get into computer science?</p>



<p>You may have noticed that many Objectivists are into programming, why do you think that is?</p>



<p>What is induction?</p>



<p>Why is induction important? Also, why do you think so many people either don’t think about it or think that it is as impotent as they do?</p>



<p>Why do you think induction is so dismissed today?</p>



<p>How is a computer so useful in showing the immense power of induction?</p>



<p>Who was Charles Babbage?</p>



<p>What were some of his more interesting ideas?</p>



<p>What were the Difference and Analytical Engines? Do any of these machines qualify as a computer?</p>



<p>Why did he consider such machines so important in his time?</p>



<p>Why  were his machines not more widely employed in his time?</p>



<p>Who was Ada Lovelace and why do you suppose so few people know that name?</p>



<p>We might talk about this another time, but in the lecture you talk about the work of Francis Bacon. Do you think his work is relevant today?</p>



<p>Briefly, how might you use induction to invent something new, such as a computer?</p>



<p>Tell me about some of the philosophical ideas that are implicitly or explicitly held by many in this field today. In particular, talk about the influence of Bertrand Russell and his, let&#8217;s say, disciple, Alan Turning.</p>



<p>How does the philosophical ideas of Turing compare to Babbage?</p>



<p>What about their ideas on computers? How do they differ?</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on the Turing Test. Does it really have any useful implications when it comes to AI?</p>



<p>What are the fundamental philosophical errors committed by the concept of the Turing Machine? Is the Turing Machine of any practical purpose or any other valid purpose?</p>



<p>Tell us about what you call the “Disproof by arbitrary counterexamples” thing you mention in the lecture and the consequences of this?</p>



<p>Tell us about the difference between the views of Babbage and Turing when it comes to man’s mind.</p>



<p>What is the problem with mechanical materialism and does this have any implications to AI?</p>



<p>What about the Halting problem? Even when I studied this in college, before learning about Objectivism, I could not understand how this was valid. It clearly does not apply to real computers, only to Turing’s arbitrary theoretical computer. Right?</p>



<p>What is the analytic/synthetic dichotomy and how does it apply here?</p>



<p>What are some of the consequences of Turing’s ideas and its influence on computer science?</p>



<p>You have a good list of sources on your personal website. I will include a link to it in the description of this video. But are there any books or sources that you would like to to mention right now?</p>



<p>Ok, so are there any other comments you would like? Would you like to present a quick summary?</p>

<p>Today, we are exploring the concepts of the &#8220;possible&#8221; and &#8220;impossible&#8221; and their important role in cognition, particularly in the sciences.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-possible">The Possible</h2>


<p>We must first establish the proper meaning of “possible”. I think many people, including many in science, do not grasp the meaning of this concept. Even though it is an important concept in science and all other spheres of thought.</p>



<p>Here is the definition of possible that I am using in this article:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p id="htoc-relating-to-a-claim-for-which-there-is-some-evidence-for-a-claim-is-possible-if-some-evidence-exists-to-support-it-being-true-and-there-is-none-that-proves-that-it-is-not-true">Relating to a claim for which there is some evidence for. A claim is possible if some evidence exists to support it being true and there is none that proves that it is not true.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-a-claim-is-possible-if-you-can-find-some-evidence-to-support-it">A claim is possible if you can find some evidence to support it. </h3>


<p>The claim does not have to be proven true, there simply needs to be some evidence in favor of it. I consider a theory which is proven possible as it meets the above criteria. </p>



<p>In order to take any claim seriously, you should first establish that the claim is at least possible. There must be some amount of evidence that supports the claim. There must be a reason that the claim is potentially true. That the claim being made matches the fact of reality.  If you cannot do this, then your claim is arbitrary. There is no way to connect it back to reality of any kind.</p>



<p>Something is not “possible” simply because one cannot think why it is not true. One has to have a reason we should consider it to be true.</p>



<p>“X is possible” means: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p id="htoc-that-according-to-the-context-of-my-knowledge-there-is-some-evidence-that-x-is-true-and-none-that-proves-that-it-is-not-true">That according to the context of my knowledge, there is some evidence that X is true and none that proves that it is not true.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Note that there may not be very <em>much</em> evidence that supports X, but there must be at least some evidence.</p>



<p>The evidence might not be very conclusive, and the truth of X may still need to be verified. Tt least I have established the <em>possibility</em> of the claim. At least I have established some reason to believe that the claim might be valid.</p>



<p>Let’s take an example.</p>



<p>I wonder if humans might have evolved via a process of natural selection from some other species. I have not yet established that this is possible. It is just speculation. That I have guessed that this might be the case is not the same as establishing that it is possible. A guess in the absence of evidence does not establish that something is possible.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="416" height="480" src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chimpGuy.jpg" alt="Chimpanzee." class="wp-image-26305" srcset="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chimpGuy.jpg 416w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chimpGuy-260x300.jpg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hey, seems plausible to me, this chimp looks like many people I know &#8230;</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>So, I then try to find evidence that would suggest such a thing. What kind of evidence might show this? I could look for evidence that ancient apes had primitive versions of some features humans have and that over time, later species of apes developed versions of these features that are ever closer to the version of those features shared by humans.</p>



<p>For instance, I could look at the skull of some very ancient apes. I might notice that these skulls have brain cases larger than some of their earlier relatives. These brain cases are larger than some other human relatives. However, their brain cases are not as large as the brain cases possessed by human skulls. I may then notice that later species of apes have still larger brain cases. And later generations have still larger brain cases than that. </p>



<p>And so on, so that the closer these species get to humans in time, the larger the brain cases possessed by these apes and the more human like their brain cases are. </p>



<p>What would this show? It suggests that as time progresses, that the successive species of apes are becoming more and more like humans in terms of their brain cases. We can say the same about other skeletal structures and parts of their genome! We can show that over time, we see apes that are developing increasingly human-like pelvises, for instance.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucySkull.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="256" height="258" src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucySkull.jpg" alt="Skull of an ancient pre-human ape." class="wp-image-26308" srcset="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucySkull.jpg 256w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucySkull-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lucySkull-70x70.jpg 70w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">There is much evidence that man evolved from other apes. Evidence such as this Australopithecus skull.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Therefore, it seems possible that man evolved from an ape! I have not simply asserted that it is so because I imagine it is so. I have concluded that it might be so, based on some evidence that seems to suggest this.</p>



<p>Am I certain of this? No, I might not be. I might think that this is not very conclusive yet. However, I have some reason, based on evidence, to think that it might be true. I have a <em>basis</em> for my belief that man evolved from these earlier species of apes.</p>



<p>Of course, in the modern age, we have now proven beyond all rational doubt humans did indeed evolve from other apes and that humans are still apes! We have so much evidence for this that it would be perverse to suggest that we did not evolve from apes. Sadly, this does not stop millions of Creationists from asserting that we did not evolve from apes. </p>



<p>However, suppose that I simply declare that man evolved from apes. Suppose that I have no evidence of any kind to suggest that this is true. I just assert that it is so because I simply believe it to be so, based on faith.</p>



<p>This is speculation. It is not the same as establishing that something is possible. You have no reason, no evidence, to believe it might be true. One cannot base an argument solely on speculation. Then you have simply asserted it on faith.</p>

<p>This is the transcript of an interview with my friend Narendra Kumar on the issue of science education. We discussed many things, including the difficulties of learning physics, problems with concretization, the role of mathematics and its relationship with science, the beauty of the science and more.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>I answered some of the questions he prepared in advance and he offered several insightful clarifying questions and commentary. It was a very good interview and we covered a lot of ground in about seventy minute.</p>



<p>This was supposed to be a livestream available on YouTube. However there were severe audio issues and much of the audio is unusable. However, I have created this transcript without losing anything significant from the original discussion.</p>



<p>At a later date I will present an audio reading of this interview which is mostly my answers but with several of Narendra&#8217;s insightful comments. For now, you have this transcript.</p>



<p>I trust that you will find this interesting and informative. The transcript is available below as a PDF, please <a href="http://localhost/rational/transcripts/MetaphysicsOfPhysicsInterviewWithNarendra.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="http://localhost/rational/transcripts/MetaphysicsOfPhysicsInterviewWithNarendra.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here download it</a>.</p>



<p>Please note that some of our interviews reference &#8220;Metaphysics of Physics&#8221;. This was the previous incarnation of the Rational Metaphysician.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="excerpt-of-the-interview-on-science-education">Excerpt of the Interview on Science Education</h2>


<p><strong>Dwayne</strong>: Okay. Hi everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Metaphysics of Physics.<br><strong><br>Narendra:</strong> Hi.<br><br>Today I have my friend Narendra with us from India, via the magic of the internet. Say hi to our audience.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Hello everybody!<br><strong><br>Dwayne:</strong> He teaches English studies. And he likes to use holistic education methods. And he has a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering and an MSc in Economics.<br><br>We are going to learn about some issues in science and science education. We&#8217;ll be focusing on physics, but a lot of other branches of science, particularly mathematics, will come up as well. Narendra has given me lots of good questions beforehand.<br><strong><br>Narendra:</strong> Yeah, they&#8217;ve already given. And so, thank you, Dwayne, I would like to say something.<br><br>I am happy that I&#8217;ve come on live with you. I&#8217;ve been watching your posts and the way you over-explain. I really love that. So, I thought we&#8217;ll connect, and thanks for agreeing to that.<br><br>And thanks also for the fantastic preparation you have done. Because I gave these questions much earlier, almost, I think two weeks back. And he wrote the answers down. So that&#8217;s very unique. People don&#8217;t do that.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>Well, I like to be prepared.<br><br><strong>Narendra: </strong>Yeah, I know, I know. I&#8217;d like to tell the audience that these questions have already been given. So, there&#8217;s no need for me to ask them. He will be telling the question.<br><br>And I will be adding things. If I think that there is anything if I feel a general audience needs it. If they need some clarification or if I need some clarification, I&#8217;ll butt in. But I would like Dwayne to talk.Dwayne: Yes.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> Okay, then we go ahead.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>Okay, let&#8217;s get started with the first question. And this question is whether it is difficult to learn physics. And here&#8217;s what I have to say on that.<br><br>Now, of course, physics is a very fundamental subject. Some people might have the idea that this should make it easy, but I do not think that should be the case. Fundamental is not the same as easy.<br><br>The subject matter of physics is essentially all of physical reality. You can take the view that that is looking out at all of physical reality and seeing how all of this works. Basically, everything that is physical is something to do with physics.<br><br>But in practice, this is not actually easy. Once you start doing physics, you will very quickly find that you need math, lots of math, to do much of anything.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="450" height="338" src="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hard-math.jpg" alt="Complicated math." class="wp-image-26413" srcset="https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hard-math.jpg 450w, https://dwaynedavies.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hard-math-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is not where physics stops. It where it should really get going &#8230;</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Narendra:</strong> Yes.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> You need to be able to quantify the things like velocity, and acceleration and forces and how forces lead to motion and stuff. You need mathematics to identify, quantify, understand all these relationships. We will go into the role of math in a later question, and so we won&#8217;t go into that too<br>much now.<br><br><strong>Narendra: </strong>Yeah.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> But the math can get really complicated, really fast. And not everyone is good at math. Certainly not in my experience. It is a very abstract subject, and it&#8217;s very difficult for some, even if it is taught properly. And in my experience, it seldom is.<br><br>Add to that the fact that you&#8217;re dealing with some very abstract things like energy. We don&#8217;t know what energy is really and Feynman himself said we don&#8217;t know. And he was one of the greatest physicists of his time.<br><br><strong>Narendra:</strong> He did not know; you can imagine it was undefined.</p>



<p><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Yeah, that was a perfectly valid point. So, in other words, energy is not easy to intuitively grasp. And then there&#8217;s light. We don&#8217;t know what light really is. They say it&#8217;s a particle and a wave. But, well, no.<br><br>Even trying to visualize an atom can be hard. Remember the show the Big Bang Theory? You have that picture of the electrons orbiting the nucleus like little moons.<br><br>This is an okay way of visualizing an atom. It is good enough for high school physics, maybe first-year college physics. But according to quantum physics, this is wrong. But how do we visualize it?<br><strong><br>Narendra:</strong> Exactly.<br><br><strong>Dwayne: </strong>We don&#8217;t know, quantum physics has not given us an answer. It doesn&#8217;t give us any answers.</p>



<p>So, you could say that the subject matter of physics is non-trivial to understand. It can get quite abstract. But there is another problem.<br><br>Many of the problems of modern physics make this a lot harder than it should be. You see, there is a &#8220;shut up and calculate&#8221; approach that is widely taken.<br><br><strong>Narendra: </strong>Shut and calculate.<br><br><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Yeah.<br><br><strong>Narendra: </strong>Shut up and calculate. Yeah, that is funny. Shut up and calculate.<br><br>Dwayne: Yes, exactly. That is an exact quote, although I cannot remember who said it offhand.<br><br><strong>Narendra: </strong>Oh, my.</p>

<p>Today we have an interview with Warren Fahy, author of the books Fragment and Pandemonium. We are going to talk about these books as well as about some biology stuff. Should be fun!</p>



<p>Some of you may not know what these books are. Well, Warren is going to tell us all about them in a little bit. But they are science thrillers something along the lines of Jurassic Park.</p>



<p>You can probably gather by the fact that I am interviewing him about these books, that I have read them and probably enjoy them.</p>



<p>Yes, I have read them and I do enjoy them. Fragment and the sequel are amazingly interesting books with some extremely compelling biological theories.</p>



<p>There are some truly terrifying, nightmare creatures in both of them. They make the dinosaurs and monsters in other books seem tame. Dragons? T-Rexes? The critters in these books, such as spigers are much deadlier and scarier.</p>

<p>I also quite like the main cast of characters, but I cannot talk about that very much without spoilers. But two of them are biologists and they may or may not have some fascinating biological ideas, new and old.</p>



<p>Highly recommended. But more than that and as entertaining as the scary monsters are, you might also learn something reading this.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="brief-excerpt">Brief Excerpt</h2>


<p><strong>Dwayne:</strong> Hello, welcome to episode twenty-five of the Metaphysics of Physics podcast.<br><br>I am Dwayne Davies, your occasional host. Today we are going to interview Warren Fahy, the author of the bestselling books Fragment and Pandemonium.<br><br>Some of you may not know what these books are. Well, Warren is going to tell us all about them in a little bit. But they are science thrillers something along the lines of Jurassic Park.<br><br>You can probably gather by the fact that I am interviewing him about these books, that I have read them and probably enjoy them. Yes, I have read them and I do enjoy them.<br><br>Fragment and the sequel are amazingly interesting books with some extremely compelling biological theories.<br><br>There are some truly terrifying, nightmare creatures in both of them. They make the dinosaurs and monsters in other books seem tame. Dragons? T-Rexes? The critters in these books, such as spigers are<br>much deadlier and scarier.<br><br>I also quite like the main cast of characters, but I cannot talk about that very much without spoilers. But two of them are biologists and they may or may not have some fascinating biological ideas, new and old.<br><br>Highly recommended. But more than that and as entertaining as the scary monsters are, you might also learn something reading this.<br><br>All right, now we have that out of the way, let’s get back into things.<br><br>Alright, thank you for being here Warren.<br><br>Give us a brief introduction to Fragment and Pandemonium. Later questions will focus more on the science and the like, so maybe, for now, focus more on the theme and the plots.<br><br><strong>Warren:</strong> Perfect. Well, Fragment and Pandemonium are science thrillers. They are somewhat in the vein of Michael Crichton books, which happened to be my favorite kind of thriller.<br><br>I like to read a thriller, get something out of it, get some new information and to learn something. So that was the kind of book I decided I wanted to write.Since I was a kid, I&#8217;ve been writing. </p>



<p>And I have been studying evolution ever since I dug a fossil out of the hills behind my grandparent’s home when I was eight. Ever since then I&#8217;ve been fascinated by evolution. And so, I decided to mine that avenue for a thriller.<br><br>I hadn&#8217;t really seen anyone ever deal with the concept of a completely separate evolution that was isolated and went off in a completely different direction. Resulting in an entire ecosystem of almost alien creatures. If you went back far enough, I figured you could make a very compelling world.<br><br>And so, Fragment is a story of a fragment of an ancient super-continent that had been isolated for 550 million years. And which was lost in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean in the middle of the Roaring Forties. Which is a current that ships try to avoid in their shipping routes.<br><br>I decided to put a reality TV show that is circumnavigating the world, in the path of this island. And what they discover, of course, is an alien world. Such a dangerous world that they&#8217;re almost all slaughtered on live television as they land.<br><br>And this calls attention to the United States government. The Navy isolates the island and sends in a team of scientists to find out what in the world is going on.<br><br>And what they discover is a world that if any of the species from it were to escape, and get to the rest of the world, it would be only a matter of time before they knocked out the legs from every single ecosystem on planet Earth. And so, that&#8217;s the premise of Fragment.<br><br>Pandemonium is the sequel. It has some of the survivors moving on to yet another ecosystem that has been isolated in a giant cave system under the Ural Mountains in a fictitious country.<br><br>And within that cave system, the former Soviet Union has built a gigantic city from which to escape any possible pandemonium from any kind of worldwide nuclear conflagration.<br><br>And so, then we discover an entirely different universe of creatures. We discover an ecosystem that descended not Cambrian era like Fragment but descended from the Devonian.<br><br>One in which the ecosystem is chiefly mostly molluscs instead of arthropods, like the Cambrian era descendants. And so, we once again we have another entire menu of crazy monster animals to deal with.So those are the two science-heavy books and they incorporate a lot of different new theories and required a lot of interesting research.<br><br>Dwayne: Well, that fossil you dug up when you were eight, did you ever find out what it was?<br><br>Warren: I did, it was just one leaf from a fern. </p>



<p>And my uncle was a geophysicist. And he identified it for me. He had collected a lot of trilobites from a nearby quarry and that had those really fired my imagination.<br><br>So, many years later, I would write Fragment about a world that had descended from that era, the era of trilobites. But what if they had gone off on their own way separate from everything else on planet Earth? What would they look like half a billion years later?<br><br>Dwayne: Hmm, OK. Now we can talk about some of the science ideas in the book. Tell us about some of those.<br><br>Warren: Well, since I&#8217;ve been studying evolution since I was a kid, I have been sort of a like an armchair biologist. I have always been endlessly fascinated by the process of evolution.<br><br>And three theories along the way occurred to me while I was studying various aspects of evolution. Two such theories are presented in Fragment and they are original theories.<br><br>One of them has gotten some interest from some actual geneticists who are studying lifespan. And that particular theory the theory of lifespan describes what dictates the lifespan of all species on Earth.<br><br>It was, basically, derived from looking at barnacles. And barnacles are something that fascinated Darwin to no end. They are amazing creatures which people don&#8217;t seem to really understand.<br><br>They are crustaceans like crabs or lobsters. And they&#8217;re obviously the weirdest crustacean on earth. And they only live for about two years. But mussels, that live right next to them, have almost an unlimited lifespan. They can live up to 70 years.<br><br>So, I was thinking, why in the world, would these two species have such a vastly different lifespan? And as I studied it, I realized that there was a difference between the way they procreate.Of course, mussels procreate by this huge bloom of sex cells that they all release all at the same time. Trillions of cells that drift in a cloud and end up creating the next generation.<br><br>Barnacles, however, have the largest sexual member in proportion to body size of any animal on earth. They must procreate by literally reaching it over to the next neighbor next to it in order to inseminate<br>that neighbor. That is how they create the next generation.<br><br>So that was a clue and the fact that they reach sexual maturity in one year and die. The fact that they die by the time their offspring reach sexual maturity was a giant clue.<br><br>Of course, all species on Earth become unable to procreate if they mate with their offspring. And there are all kinds of different reasons and biological barriers that stop that from happening.<br><br>And if they didn&#8217;t stop that from happening, then that species would die out in very short order. Even plants that procreate with their own offspring will become unable to procreate in only two or three<br>generations.<br><br>So, as I started to check this theory out by looking at animals and plants with lifespans, I found that the theory held true with absolutely every species across the board. Any animal that could theoretically,<br>crossbreed with their own offspring had a fixed lifespan at twice the age of sexual maturity. So that they could not compete with the next generation and mate with their own offspring.<br><br>And this is true from everything from redwoods and sequoias, to whales and to any species, you can name. But certain species get around it without lifespan, because they don&#8217;t need it.<br><br>For instance, the sequoia has made the same way that mussels do. Or the coral reefs do with giant clouds of sex sells that are all released at once. And the chances of them breeding with their own offspring are so slim that they&#8217;re infinitesimal. They are vanishingly small.<br><br>If you look at something like some whales, they congregate in giant groups and they don&#8217;t meet for life or anything. They just randomly mix in and they meet several times a year and that makes it impossible for them.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Some people, including alleged champions of reason and science think that there is no such thing as settled science. Let's bust that unscientific nonsense.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Is there any such thing as settled science? I am going to argue that there is.</p>



<p>What do I mean by &#8220;settled&#8221; science? A scientific claim that any rational person would accept as true and established beyond any reasonable doubt. We do not expect such theories to be replaced by an alternate theory.</p>



<p>You might object that this is not very scientific! We must always keep in mind that we might be wrong. We need to be ready to adjust what we know to accommodate new information that might cast what we know today into doubt. Keep in mind that we are fallible and that we might come to invalid conclusions.</p>



<p>All knowledge, including science, is contextual. We study reality and, based on what we observe, we form logical conclusions. But we can only account for that we know about.</p>



<p>For instance, take Newtonian gravity. In the context of not knowing what happens near the speed of light, it was entirely reasonable to accept Newton&#8217;s laws of gravity as settled science. We did not know what happened at extremely high velocities, so we had no reason to doubt Newtonian gravity. Newtonian gravity is valid, within the context of things not moving close to the speed of light. </p>



<p>We then expanded our context to account for things near light speed. We realized that in that context, Einstein’s relativity provides better mathematics for what happens with gravity at near light speed. Does that mean that we had no reason to be certain about Newtonian gravity? </p>



<p>No, it does not. We knew it was an accurate description of gravity at speeds much lower than the speed of light.</p>



<p>That is why NASA uses Newtonian gravity for most purposes, even though relativistic equations would be more accurate. Newtonian gravity is easier to deal with and is extremely accurate at the speeds NASA works with.</p>

<p>Certainty is contextual. Suppose, in the context of our knowledge, the available evidence supports a theory. We should be certain about that theory. But what we are wrong? After all, we used to believe some strange things.</p>



<p>We used to think things burned because of phlogiston. Phlogiston was a mysterious substance that was thought to exist in all combustible bodies.</p>



<p>We used to think that dinosaurs were all sluggish, scaly critters that probably lived in swamps to support their massive weight.</p>



<p>Yes, sometimes we are wrong. Sometimes the facts do not support our theories. There are some theories that we have no business accepting as anything more than a plausible hypothesis.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="these-are-the-theories-that-do-not-make-up-the-body-of-settled-science-these-are-the-theories-we-should-not-consider-settled">These are the theories that do not make up the body of settled science. These are the theories we should not consider settled. </h3>


<p>It would be dishonest to consider a theory settled in the absence of evidence. It would also be dishonest to consider a theory settled if we did not understand it well enough to be sure it was consistent with all the available evidence.</p>



<p>Some theories are entirely reasonable within the context of the available evidence. Sometimes all the known evidence points to these theories being true. </p>



<p>Sometimes we understand the theory well enough to conclude it is entirely consistent with the facts. If the facts are consistent with that theory and only that theory, then we can be certain that the theory in question is true.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-should-not-entertain-serious-doubts-about-theories-that-have-substantial-evidence-behind-them">We should not entertain serious doubts about theories that have substantial evidence behind them. </h3>


<p>We can always <em>imagine</em> that we might disprove some theories. However, we should be certain about a theory if all the available evidence points to it being true.</p>



<p>Certainty does not require us to account for, by magic, for the possibility of a context of knowledge we do not currently possess. We can be certain that something is true even if there is something we do not know about now that may later show that it is not true.</p>



<p>Certainty is contextual, it is valid to be certain based on the context of available evidence. Provided that we are willing to address any evidence that arises, should the context of our knowledge change. We can be certain something is true. And yet adjust our theories when the context of our knowledge expands.</p>



<p>However, there are theories that we can consider completely and forever settled. These are theories we know with certainty and can prove with no shadow of a doubt to be true.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-know-these-facts-are-true-and-that-we-cannot-show-them-to-be-false">We know these facts are true and that we cannot show them to be false.</h3>


<p>It would contradict known facts of reality if they were not true. Things would have to not be what we know they are.</p>



<p>Examples of these would be that atoms exist. We know atoms exist; we have seen them. If they did not exist, almost everything we know about chemistry and atomic physics would not be true.</p>



<p>We know evolution happens. We might not know everything about how it happens, but we know it does. If I wanted disprove evolution, we would have to invalidate almost everything we know about biology and the known facts of biology would have to be other than what they are.</p>



<p>We know the Earth is round and that it orbits the Sun. To invalidate this, the direct evidence of our senses would have to be wrong! That we can see that the Earth is round would have to be fake. And how would we explain the observed behavior of Earth if it does not orbit the Sun? </p>

<p>We can say without a shadow of a doubt that theories like this are absolutely and forever settled and that we will never find anything that contradicts them. No such evidence is even <a href="https://dwaynedavies.com/the-possible-and-the-impossible/" data-type="post" data-id="35">possible</a>. </p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-completely-settled-such-science-it-would-be-nonsensical-to-pretend-otherwise">We completely settled such science. It would be nonsensical to pretend otherwise!</h3>


<p>So yes, there is such a thing as settled science. It is foolish to pretend otherwise. And it would be intellectually dishonest and non-scientific to pretend that we have not settled this!</p>



<p>It is unscientific to question that the Earth might not be round. Or that evolution does not happen. Or that atoms do not exist. Why? Because we have seen that the Earth is round! Are we to question the evidence of our senses so that we can become a Flattard?</p>



<p>It would contradict the obvious implications of the evidence of our senses to believe atoms do not exist. Additionally, we have seen atoms! It would go against observable facts and their logical implications to question that evolution happens.</p>



<p>It would be unscientific to question that light behaves like a wave. This would go against the evidence of our senses and the logical implications of that evidence.</p>



<p>To question theories we can show are irrefutable facts based on the evidence of our senses and the logical implications of such, is unscientific.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="your-belief-that-the-irrefutable-facts-of-reality-might-be-wrong-is-completely-nonsensical-and-unscientific">Your belief that the irrefutable facts of reality might be wrong is completely nonsensical and unscientific. </h3>


<p>The ability to entertain alternatives to the way reality works is not indicative of science. It is closer to the mindset of the religious person that must evade reality to maintain the possibility of his delusions. The questioning of everything, even things we can prove beyond any reasonable doubt, is little better than those that deny science outright. </p>



<p>To deny the absolute certainty of that which we can show beyond any reasonable doubt, is to either partially deny the veracity of the evidence or fail to understand that science is about the study of an objective reality, not blind guesswork.</p>
