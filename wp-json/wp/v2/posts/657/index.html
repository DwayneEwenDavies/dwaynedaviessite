That value might be to understand how to deal with the world around you and stay alive. It might be how to get lots of money and buy that house you want. It could be any value that you might imagine. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"17ba\">However, for a value and claim to be of worth, it must help us achieve some purpose based on reality. If not, of what use could it possibly be to anyone?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve good values, we must deal with the world as it really is. We must understand how the world works and deal with reality as it is. Only the things that help us do this help us to achieve values. Therefore, in order to help us achieve values in the real world, a claim must have a valid relation to the world. It must have some relation to observable facts. If not, then it is impossible for it to have any merit. That which has no relation to the real world is useless in achieving values. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we are going to make or evaluate claims about reality, the only ones that are of any use in achieving values are those that correspond with reality. Truth is correspondence with reality. Truth is that which corresponds to the way things are. Therefore, the only claim that has any merit is that which has some truth to it.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"419\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/firmament500.jpg\" alt=\"Earth under a dome (the firmament).\" class=\"wp-image-26326\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/firmament500.jpg 500w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/firmament500-300x251.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Bible seems to think the Earth is flat and with a over it. Possibly with stars embedded into the dome. But we should not take its word for any of that, should we?<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But how do we know whether a claim is true? You must first establish the possibility of the claim. If we make a claim, we should establish that there is some evidence or proof behind it. If you make an assertion without evidence, we cannot show it to correspond to reality. That assertion is, therefore, entirely without merit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we establish whether something is possible? We discuss that in <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/the-possible-and-the-impossible\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/the-possible-and-the-impossible\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this article on possibility.<\/a> Indeed, we took much of this section from that article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize that article, before we take any claim seriously, we must first establish that there is some evidence that it might be true. Otherwise, it is a waste of time considering it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2b1f\">If we make a claim, we should establish that there is some evidence or proof behind it. Why should anyone accept any claim in the absence of evidence? Why would anyone do this when it could have no objective value? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because they want it to be true. They have no cognitive reason to want it to be true. That person simply feels that it is preferable for it to be true. They feel an emotional response to the assertions being made, which makes them want to believe that the assertion must be true. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no reason to accept something merely because you want it to be true. Emotions are not tools of cognition. A claim is not valid because you wish it to be so. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that is what faith is, the acceptance of things for which there is no evidence or proof. Faith is, therefore, the acceptance of baseless assertions for no reason and because someone wants it to be true based on emotion. However, emotions are not a valid reason for believing something.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-the-harm\">What is the Harm?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p id=\"fba5\">Faith and reality are always in conflict. So is virtually every claim accepted for no reason and defended against reason. Knowing the truth is not a trivial task. It requires careful observation of reality, serious thought and a dedication to understanding the facts for what they are. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a0eb\">Faith is the refusal to do any of that. Faith is the attempt to bypass thought and proceed directly to the truth by wishing empty assertions to be fact. As though wanting something to be true somehow makes it so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"622c\">Assertions accepted on faith are almost always wrong. There is no real chance that anything you believe for no reason corresponds to the facts. There is essentially no chance that your blind assertions are true.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Franz-Von-Stuck-adam-and-EveSmaller.jpg\" alt=\"Eve presents Adam the apple in the snake's mouth.\" class=\"wp-image-26328\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Franz-Von-Stuck-adam-and-EveSmaller.jpg 640w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Franz-Von-Stuck-adam-and-EveSmaller-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The story of Adam and Eve condemns man for having the knowledge of good and evil. Condemns man for seeking an understanding of the world&#8230;<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Which is why the Bible is almost invariably wrong about everything. It is wrong about the shape of the Earth, and when it asserts that pi is exactly three. It is wrong when it pretends that Earth has a glass dome above it that lets the rain in. There are lots of other silly examples like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, almost everything every religion says about the universe is wrong. That is why their cosmologies are always wrong. That is why, when religions say what is right or wrong, they are frequently wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many religions prohibit things like theft or murder, in certain circumstances. The Bible includes commandments not to steal or murder. Most of us would agree that these are objectively wrong. These are examples of the few instances of things in the Bible that reasonable people might agree with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Bible does not forbid murder because of any valid reasoning. It does not forbid killing people because of any real respect for individual rights. It does this because it asserts God would not like this for reasons that are not entirely clear.  It is the same with stealing, which is not forbidden because of any arguments to do with property rights, but again for reasons that God does not make clear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even when it forbids things that reasonable people might consider wrong, it does not do so for valid reasons. Religions forbid things for invalid reasons and manage to once again prove that they are wrong. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f195\">Once you have rejected reality and embraced faith, what does that leave you to believe? Whatever you want to believe in, as long as we assume it blindly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"63fe\">Most often, this takes the form of whatever is emotionally satisfying or seems superficially easy to grasp. Or which provides moral guidance with little to no actual connection to how man should act to be happy and thrive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0e6a\">But just because something is easy to understand does not mean that it is true. Something like the theory of a flat Earth might seem intuitive. However, the Earth is not flat. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seemed intuitive to the Greeks that there were no <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Irrational_number\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">irr<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Irrational_number\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ational numbers<\/a>. However, they were wrong and irrational numbers turn up all the time in mathematics. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b1fa\">It might seem obvious that nothing could exist without a Creator. But it does not matter how intuitive this might seem, it is incorrect. It does not matter if you think that a claim seems intuitive, simple or obvious. That does not make it correct. Many of the most important numbers used in mathematics, such as pi [footnote]the ratio between the circumference of a circle to its diameter.[\/footnote] are irrational numbers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"4531\">Claims that seem intuitive are frequently wrong. Reality rarely conforms to our simple intuitions. What many people think is obvious and logical is proof that they are ignorant and do not know how to think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"128d\">The religions of every almost culture believe in a spiritual existence after death where the spirit endures after the body dies. Why? Not because there is any reason to believe this. No, but because this is emotionally satisfying. Many people cannot deal with the fact that their consciousness will cease existing after their body dies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people cannot imagine what happens after they die. They cannot imagine how their consciousness could just go away. So it is comforting to imagine it does not happen.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"517\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/1024px-The_Reign_of_Heavens_MET_DP823640.jpg\" alt=\"Heaven\" class=\"wp-image-26329\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/1024px-The_Reign_of_Heavens_MET_DP823640.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/1024px-The_Reign_of_Heavens_MET_DP823640-300x194.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/1024px-The_Reign_of_Heavens_MET_DP823640-768x496.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Yes, Heaven may be an emotionally satisfying idea, but it just encourages people to waste their life.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>There are also those that cannot grasp that there can be any objective morality in the natural world. These people believe that the only way that any morality could exist is if some intelligent being imposed his will upon the world. They do not grasp that morality is not a matter of what some cosmic being imposes upon the world. They cannot grasp the concept of objective morality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite what they believe, objective morality exists. There are principles of right and wrong that are true regardless of what any mind asserts. What is right or wrong depends on the nature of reality and what is good or bad according to a standard. That standard is life. What is right or wrong are objective facts and can be determined by using life as a standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The religious rarely recognize the existence of objective morality. If there is no objective morality, then where could morality come from? The only alternative is for morality to be a matter of arbitrary say-so. The only alternative is for someone to tell them what is right or wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people look for powerful, allegedly wise supernatural beings to tell them what is moral. Gods fit that need nicely. They need a system of morality to guide their actions. Since they think there is no objective morality, then gods must provide that moral code for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If God is going to provide a moral code, it is only logical that God gets to enforce his moral code. How is he to do this?  There must be some way of enforcing God&#8217;s moral judgement, surely?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is a major function of the afterlife in many religions. Once you die, the gods will judge you according to the morality of the religion and reward or punish you accordingly. If you are a devout follower of the religion, the gods will reward you in the world after this one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a kind of coercive control. It says to people that they have to toe the line of the religion and believe what they say. God will punish them if they disobey, not only in this life but after this life. However, if they listen to the religious teachings, they will receive spiritual rewards beyond anything in this life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This creates a powerful emotional incentive to believe whatever the religion tells them. To ignore any niggling doubts that they might have. To not listen to anyone that might try to argue with them and to just believe. They only get all of that nice afterlife stuff if obey the moral teachings of the religion and do the bidding of the clergy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e2c5\">Every religion tries to offer its followers moral teachings. We all need moral guidance to help choose which actions to take in life. Once you have rejected reality, you must get that moral guidance from somewhere. Religions are more than happy to offer that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0209\">This guidance typically comes with plenty of threats and other forms of emotional manipulation. It usually includes threats of fate worse than death intended to scare the worshipers into obedience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d5dd\">When you have no argument for why someone should do what you say, then you will need to appeal to emotions. You will need to make arbitrary claims intended to scare them into obedience. Arbitrary claims that promise happiness for obedience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1f6b\">If you have no real arguments, then appeal to emotions is all you have to get your followers to obey your moral teachings. It is, therefore, hardly surprising that the most devoutly religious people are also the most heavily emotionally invested in their religion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9d66\">They are told that if they have faith then the gods will reward them with impossible miracles. However, if they disobey, they will suffer terrifying torments.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/800px-God_AKA_Mark_McEwen.jpg\" alt=\"God and some angels.\" class=\"wp-image-26330\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/800px-God_AKA_Mark_McEwen.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/800px-God_AKA_Mark_McEwen-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/800px-God_AKA_Mark_McEwen-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">God is very insecure. Apparently he needs us to believe in him. As if otherwise he might stop existing&#8230; <\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p id=\"c1d7\">The devoutly religious are heavily invested in this nonsense. They believe that religion is the only means of moral guidance they have. They refuse to consider that there can be any other alternatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"5ec2\">It should come as little surprise that many of these people desperately cling to the teachings of their religion. Then it should also come as little surprise that since reality conflicts with religion, the devout will defend their religion against reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"fb02\">Their faith will invariably clash with science and reality. Faith says one thing, but science will always say another. Therefore, if they perceive science as a threat to their faith, it is the practice of science that they must discard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2e5c\">When reality invariably clashes with their religion, they have two fundamental choices: to reject their faith as dishonest or to reject reality. In embracing faith, they have already rejected reality, so they almost invariably continue to reject reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2a7a\">Many religious people know what the facts are but will not abandon their faith. Reality gets rejected for clashing with their delusions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0bd5\">The devoutly religious cannot allow reality to destroy their faith. If faith and reality itself clash, then it is the offending reality that must lose out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"4751\">Faith requires that it is defended against the intrusion of reason. It is the acceptance of assertions with no attempt to discover facts. It is an attempt to defend oneself against inconvenient truths.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<p id=\"16d7\">The most dishonest position possible is knowing what the facts are and choosing to pretend that they are not so. This is exactly what the devout must do to continue believing. Thus, the devout are some of the most dishonest people that you are likely to meet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"18df\">The truth rarely matters to the devoutly religious. If it mattered to them, they would not be devoutly religious. The devout would not have faith in anything at all!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0327\">If they embraced reality at the expense of their faith, they would get none of the rewards and all those terrible punishments. Of course, it never occurs to them that fighting reality is impossible. It never occurs to them that those that fight reality must always face the consequences of their dishonesty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cb78\">As with any form of dishonesty, there are consequences for holding faith in anything. Only honest men can deal with reality as it is. Dishonest men hide from reality and pretend things are not what they are. To the extent they need this knowledge to deal with reality, the dishonest person cannot do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"01d7\">That is the harm in religion. It is the refusal to know reality and to accept whatever one wishes to believe. Assertions accepted on faith are almost always wrong about anything of consequence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e950\">Faith is the epistemological equivalent of choosing to walk around blindfolded while declaring that you can see. But you cannot see. Reality is what it is, despite you trying to make it whatever you want it to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you blind yourself to reality, then you cannot deal with it properly. You render yourself unable to deal with reality as it really is. <\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/faith_Blindfolded.jpg\" alt=\"Man putting on blindfold. \" class=\"wp-image-26331\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/faith_Blindfolded.jpg 400w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/faith_Blindfolded-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">This is your brain on faith.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>If you accept that morality is determined by the arbitrary decree from above, then you will never discover an objective morality in this world. You will never discover a proper moral code to guide your actions. When you cannot achieve happiness in the real world, you will have wasted your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you accept that this life does not matter, then you will sacrifice everything in this life for happiness in the afterlife or the next life. This life will be a guardian of misery, which is what many religions teach. The thing is, this is the only life you get. If you squander this life in preparing for the next, this is all you get and you will have ruined your only life for nothing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the only life you get. Do not waste it on accepting arbitrary claims for no reason. Those ideas cannot help you achieve happiness in this world. No, they are more likely to frustrate you and to prevent you from achieving happiness in the only life you will ever get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is the great tragedy of every major religion; they encourage you to throw away your happiness in this world for happiness in the life after death. They encourage you to throw away your life in this world for nothing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every major religion of Earth is selling you the ultimate scam. Similar to those people demanding that you give your hard-earned money away for a timeshare you never get to use, religions are asking you to throw away your life for a cloud paradise that exists only on paper. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no life after death. This is all you get. Live your life for the sake of your happiness here on this Earth. Do not throw it away for the delusion of some unreachable paradise that you will never reach. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"justified-trust\">Is Biblical Faith \u201cJustified Trust\u201d?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p id=\"597b\">Some might think that by \u201cfaith\u201d the Bible means \u201cjustified trust\u201d.  Many people from other religions make this kind of claim. I am about to present several Bible verses to disprove this notion for Christianity. <br><br>One can study the religious texts of other religions, present similar evidence, and come to similar conclusions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1ecd\">The Bible never uses faith in the sense of justified trust. By faith, it means blindly believing things for no good reason and <em>against <\/em>all reason. It openly tells you <em>not<\/em> to see reality but to just <em>believe<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"68f8\">Why does it do this? Because that is the only thing religions can offer anyone. Which is to have faith in empty assertions that have nothing to do with reality, empty assertions of promises beyond the observable world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"4f7a\">That is why every religion always offers immaterial, unearthly rewards. Because they cannot offer anything that relates to reality. All it can do is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Appeal_to_emotion\">appeal to emotion<\/a> and irrational, baseless desires that have nothing to do with reality<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"4f7a\">For it to  be justified trust, there would have to be a justification. Baseless appeals to emotions are not justifications. And therefore, Biblical faith is not justified trust. For that, they would require evidence and there is never any evidence for any of this. And  as we shall see, there is never supposed to be, that is the entire point of faith.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bible-quotes\">Bible Quotes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p id=\"0b30\">I took all passages from New American Standard translations of the Bible. This is a translation that is a better word-for-word translation than many others, without being overly difficult to read. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0b30\">I added all the emphasis you see for the sake of clarity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p id=\"htoc-trust-in-the-lord-with-all-your-heart-and-do-not-lean-on-your-own-understanding\"><em>\u201cTrust in the Lord with all your heart, and <\/em>do not lean on your own understanding<em>.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"htoc-proverbs-3-5-6\">Proverbs 3:5\u20136<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6b59\">You should trust blindly in the Lord.

To exercise faith is not to do so because you see a reason to do so, but because you want it to be true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c4b7\">Hebrews 11 then talks about all the wonderful rewards various faithful received after death:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p id=\"htoc-all-these-died-in-faith-without-receiving-the-promises-but-having-seen-them-and-having-welcomed-them-from-a-distance-and-having-confessed-that-they-were-strangers-and-exiles-on-the-earth\">All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. <\/p>\n<cite>Hebrews 11:13<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a pretty common technique among all major religions. They tell you not to worry about this life. Do not worry that you are not getting what you think you deserve in this life. This life does not matter, they tell you. Worry about what comes after this life. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the emotional hook, the reason many choose to believe. Not because they see any reason to. But because they fear missing out on rewards after this life. Most religions know this and they wrote their texts to take advantage of this emotional need to believe in a better life after death. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p id=\"htoc-for-we-walk-by-faith-not-by-sight-but-we-are-of-good-courage-and-prefer-to-be-absent-from-the-body-and-to-be-at-home-with-the-lord\"><em>\u201cFor we walk by faith, <\/em>not by sight &#8211; but we are of good courage and prefer to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"htoc-2-corinthians-5-7-8\">2 Corinthians 5:7-8<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"265a\">Again, look not to the outside world for reasons for having faith. There are none. What matters is not the body or the material world, but the Lord. What matters is not this world, or this life, but the next one. The one where you get to be in Heaven with God.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0aae\">Faith has nothing to do with reality. Those who have faith do not care about what reality is and what the facts are. Sight can only be a hindrance to believing what you want to believe for no reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This world is just a trial to be endured. Let us not be too concerned with life or things in this world and instead look to next life. For it is those things that matter. This kind of attitude will encourage a disdain for reality and the evidence of the senses as unimportant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What matters is being at home with the Lord. For that, we must have faith and obey what he believes. Of course, since he does not exist, we have no way of knowing what he might want. But we can have faith in what we are told he wants. Which is what the clergy tells you he wants. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is how religions control people. If you want to hear the Words of God that are your salvation, only they can tell you this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p id=\"htoc-jesus-saith-unto-him-thomas-because-thou-hast-seen-me-thou-hast-believed-blessed-are-they-that-have-not-seen-and-yet-have-believed\"><em>Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: <\/em>blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"htoc-john-20-29\">John 20:29<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"464\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/640px-Caravaggio_Doubting_Thomas.jpg\" alt=\"Doubting Thomas.\" class=\"wp-image-26333\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/640px-Caravaggio_Doubting_Thomas.jpg 640w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/640px-Caravaggio_Doubting_Thomas-300x218.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Bible portrays Doubting Thomas as an unsympathetic character for not having faith.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p id=\"81ff\">So, according to Jesus, the righteous are those that see no reason to believe something but choose to believe it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7c3a\">Blessed are those that do not use their eyes but blindly accept Jesus for no reason. Blessed are those that do not use their senses or their brain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Thomas is, as some of you may have noticed, Doubting Thomas. This is a skeptic apostle that refused to believe that Jesus resurrected himself without seeing some evidence. Indeed, let me quote John 20:24-25:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p id=\"htoc-but-thomas-one-of-the-twelve-who-was-called-didymus-was-not-with-them-when-jesus-came-so-the-other-disciples-were-saying-to-him-we-have-seen-the-lord-but-he-said-to-them-unless-i-see-in-his-hands-the-imprint-of-the-nails-and-put-my-finger-into-the-place-of-the-nails-and-put-my-hand-into-his-side-i-will-not-believe\">But Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples were saying to him, \u201cWe have seen the Lord!\u201d But he said to them, \u201cUnless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.<\/p>\n<cite>John 20:24-25<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas simply wanted some evidence of the resurrection. Jesus condemns him for expecting this and not having faith. Jesus condemns evidence and tells Thomas that faith is about blind acceptance for no reason. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas is being reasonable when he asks for some kind of evidence, but the Bible portrays such behavior as unreasonable, as it must. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blessed are those that care not for what the facts are and just believe!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p id=\"htoc-for-in-hope-we-have-been-saved-but-hope-that-is-seen-is-not-hope-for-who-hopes-for-what-he-already-sees-but-if-we-hope-for-what-we-do-not-see-through-perseverance-we-wait-eagerly-for-it\"><em>For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he <em>already<\/em> sees?

Hope, by which it seems the authors mean faith, is not really hope, if one has a reason to believe. Or so Romans insists. So did <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/rational\/interview-creating-christ-author\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"http:\/\/localhost\/rational\/interview-creating-christ-author\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">some of the Roman emperors.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"dd93\">It should not surprise us to find the Bible encouraging people not to see, not to think. Sight and thought are the antithesis of faith and the things most likely to destroy one\u2019s faith. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p id=\"ddb5\">We have seen that faith is the blind acceptance of empty assertions in the absence of proof or evidence. This blind acceptance leads people to reject reality and often to fight against it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We should note that a lack of faith is the one crime God will not forgive you for. Not blindly believing God for no reason is the ultimate sin, and blind obedience is the ultimate virtue. We will come back to this in a future article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2fba\">Faith is what the Bible demands of its followers. Not justified trust, but blind acceptance of empty assertions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9f60\">Oh ye of faith, believe because the Book says so. Believe in it because God will reward you and if you do not, he will punish you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d2a8\">I don\u2019t know about you, but I would rather deal with reality as it is. Impossible rewards and punishments will not hold me back. Live your life as you see fit, but I will live my life in this world. Not in the word of delusion offered by the Bible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What could it hurt? Faith demands that you blindly surrender your mind to the irrational demands of mystics. That you believe things for no reason. That you surrender objective morality to the arbitrary decrees of a despot. These things can only frustrate your attempt to gain happiness in this life, the only one you will ever have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But religions tell you, that does not matter. Because after you are done with this life, there is something after death. But this is not so. And yet religions demand that you give up everything in this life for a fantasy world after death. <\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"414\" height=\"599\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Thor.jpg\" alt=\"Thor with his hammer.\" class=\"wp-image-26334\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Thor.jpg 414w, http:\/\/localhost\/dwaynedavies\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Thor-207x300.jpg 207w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Would you give up all Earthly values for the Norse God Thor? He is just as arbitrary as the Christian God&#8230;<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And that is the great tragedy of faith; it demands that people surrender earthly values for nothing. You must accept things for no reason and frustrate your chance of happiness in this life. Indeed, you must give up happiness in this life for a fantasy, for nothing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what faith does. It robs you of happiness in this world for nothing. Therefore, you should never exercise faith.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This applies in non-religious contexts too. Faith in anything is a cognitive dead-end. If you accept any claim for no reason, then it is cognitively useless. It can only serve as a roadblock in your mind that impedes a proper grasp of reality, as must all arbitrary claims. This too will impede your ability to deal with the world, and to some extent, make your happiness that much harder to achieve. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No good can ever come of accepting anything on faith. It can only impede your ability to grasp reality as it is and to deal with the world. It can only hinder your happiness. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no ghostly world waiting for you after this one. Make the most of this life, the only one you get.
